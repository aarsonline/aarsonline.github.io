Pairwise comparison of the Class II catalytic domains from the Non-discriminating Aspartyl-tRNA Synthetase (<a href='/class2/asp2'>AsxRS</a>) and O-phosphoseryl-tRNA Synthetase (<a href='//'>SepRS</a>) families. 
	The cross-family RMSD is the average RMSD between pairs of structures from different families, and is
	 larger than the total RMSD, which compares structures both within- and between-families. TM scores are bound between 0 and 1. 
	 This alignment was generated automatically using 3DCOMB (Wang et al. 2011) and was not corrected with any manual adjustment.
