Methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid methionine to its cognate tRNA:





$ \text{Met} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Met} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{MetRS}} \text{Met-tRNA}^\text{Met} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



MetRS is closely related to the [LeuRS-A](/class1/leu2), [LeuRS-B](/class1/leu1), [ValRS](/class1/val), and [IleRS](/class1/ile) families, which comprise subclass Ia (Gomez and Ibba, 2020).
Members of subclass Ia are characterized by their hydrophobic amino acid substrates, the connecting peptide 2 (CP2) insertion, and a zinc finger (Sugiura et al. 2001), depicted below. 
The CP2 module is 30-40 amino acids in length (Starzyk et al. 1987) and exists as two antiparallel $\alpha$-helices on the surface of the catalytic domain. 
It appears to be essential for amino acid activation (Zhou et al. 2008).
MetRS is also one of several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases expressed by mimiviruses (Abergel et al. 2007).



## Structure

MetRS exists as a homodimer or a monomer, depending on the presence or absence of a C-terminal domain downstream from the [helical domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_CRIMVL) (Crepin et al. 2004). 
The dimerisation domain, EMAP, is only present in certain organisms and shows an OB-fold, which is also found in paralogous RNA binding proteins (Crepin et al. 2002). 
In the context of MetRS, this domain improves tRNA$^\text{Met}$ binding affinity (Blanquet et al. 1973). 
A paralog of EMAP is also found in some forms of [TyrRS](/class1/tyr) and [PheRS](/class2/phe2) (Wolf et al. 1999), and is the [anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class2/Anticodon_binding_domain_DNK) of subclass IIb AARS.
Certain cytosolic MetRS have an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase ([GST](/superfamily/class1/GST)) domain (Hadd and Perona. 2014).




## Editing

Editing activity has been characterized in MetRS which, in contrast to other members of subclass Ia, removes mischarged amino acids at the active site as opposed to a specialized editing domain (Gomez and Ibba, 2020). 
This process targets non-proteinogenic amino acids, such as homocysteine, at the pre-transfer level (Jakubowski et al. 1990).
Thermophilic archaea can adapt to lower temperatures by misacylating tRNA$^\text{Leu}$ with methionine, resulting in methionine-for-leucine mistranslations (Schwartz and Pan 2015).



## Non-translational functions

Homocysteine thiolactone is produced by bacterial and eukaryotic MetRS to prevent translational incorporation of homocysteine into proteins (Jakubowski, 2000). 

Oxidative stress and immune-stimulatory Toll-like receptor activation cause a loss of accuracy in MetRS, leading to misacylation of tRNAs with methionine to protect proteins against ROS-mediated damage (Netzer et al, 2009). This adaptive mistranslation is induced by phosphorylation of MetRS through extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2) (Lee et al., 2014). Mismethionylation was also shown for bacterial MetRS (Jones et al., 2011).  

Human MetRS localizes to the nucleolus, where ribosome biogenesis takes place, and treatment with an anti-MetRS antibody decreases rRNA production (Ko et al., 2000). 

## Clinical significance
Mutations in the human gene MARS1 encoding the cytosolic MetRS have been implied as disease-causing in Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (Gonzales et al., 2013; Hyun et al., 2014; Rips et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2019). However, incomplete penetrance has not been reported for certain MARS1 mutations (Gonzales et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2019). 

Biallelic recessive variants in the human gene MARS2 encoding the mitochondrial MetRS cause a syndrome named ARSAL for Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia with Leukoencephalopathy (firstly reported in Bayat et al. 2012). The exhaustive list of disease-causing variants (including location on the sequence and structure, the conservation of the affected residues, and the related references) can be found [here](http://misynpat.org/misynpat/PageMaker.rvt?name=MARS2).
