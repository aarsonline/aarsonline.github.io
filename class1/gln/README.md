Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in cytoplasmic protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid glutamine to its cognate tRNA$^\text{Gln}$: 

$ \text{Gln} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlnRS}} \text{Gln-tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



As discovered by Lamour and Mirande in 1994 and discussed more recently by Hadd and Perona 2014, GlnRS evolved in eukaryotes from one of the two copies of cytoplasmic glutamyl-tRNA synthetases (GluRS) that originated from a gene duplication.
 GlnRS was later acquired by certain bacteria through horizontal gene transfer (Lamour et al. 1994), but never by archaea (Tumbula et al., 2000). 
 Therefore, all eukaryotes express both GlnRS and GluRS, while all archaea and more than 90% of bacterial species studied thus far do not encode a GlnRS gene. 
 When absent, GlnRS is replaced by a 2-step pathway.  First, a non-discriminating form (GlxRS) of GluRS attaches Glu to $\text{tRNA}^\text{Gln}$. In a second step, a tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (AdT), replaces the Glu residue attached to tRNA$^\text{Gln}$ to produce the correctly acylated \text{Gln-tRNA}^\text{Gln}$ required for protein synthesis (Wilcox and Nirenberg, 1968, Schön et al., 1988, Curnow et al., 1997). Adt also corrects the misacylated product of [AsxRS](/class2/asp2/) (Becker et al., 1998).
 The non-discriminating GlxRS enzyme is thus found in all organisms that lack GlnRS, such as all archaea, which express [GlxRS-A](/class1/glu2/), as well as the majority of bacteria which have a non-discriminating variant [GlxRS-B](/class1/glu1/) (Lapointe et al., 1986), or more rarely the specialised noncognate-discriminating variant, GluGlnRS, which attaches Glu to $\text{tRNA}^\text{Gln}$ but not to its cognate $\text{tRNA}^\text{Glu}$ (Skouloubris et al. 2003, Salazar et al. 2003).


 The archaeal and eukaryotic forms 
 (GlnRS, [GluRS-E](/class1/glu3), and GlxRS-A) possess a [$\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain](/d/eq) (Satiecka et al., 1998), whereas the bacterial-like forms of the subclass (GluRS-B, [GlxRS-B](/class1/glu1), and [GluGlnRS](/class1/glu1)) are characterized by an 
 [$\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain](/d/ek),





## Structure


The N-terminal catalytic domain of GlnRS closely resembles that of [GluRS-B](/class1/glu1/) , [GluRS-E](/class1/glu3/), and [GlxRS-A](/class1/glu2/) , 
constituting subclass Ib (Perona  and Hadd 2012, Gomez et al., 2020).
Their catalytic domains are characterized by an insertion within CP1, containing a loop flanked by two helices (SC1b IM), which 
may play a role in tRNA acceptor stem recognition  (Rath et al. 1998, Nureki et al. 2010).
The $\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain of GlnRS is located at the C-terminal end (Rould et al. 1991) and is homologous with that of GlxRS-A and GluRS-E.
However it is distinct from the bacterial form GluRS-B, which instead has an $\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain.
Members of subclass Ib, alongside [ArgRS](/class1/arg/) and  [LysRS-I](/class1/lys/), require the presence of tRNA to catalyze activation of the amino acid substrate (Dubois et al. 2005).



In *Deinococcus radiodurans*, GlnRS was shown to contain a C-terminal helical domain homologous to the Yqey domain found in tRNA-dependent amidotransferases (Deniziak et al., 2007).  This domain is also found as an N-terminal appendage to many eukaryotic GlnRS enzymes (Hadd et al. 2014), where it is required for the assembly of the MARS complex (Kim et al. 2000). It may also contribute to the enzyme's ability to discriminate against tRNA$^\text{Glu}$ (Hadd et al. 2014).



Crystal structures of *E. coli* GlnRS bound in various combinations to tRNA$^\text{Gln}$, ATP, glutamine, a sulfamoyl analog of glutaminyl adenylate, 
and ATP analogs allow reliable structural modeling of both steps of the aminoacylation reaction. 
Hairpinning of the 3'-end of tRNA$^\text{Gln}$ into the active site positions the nucleophilic 2'-O of tRNA A76 adjacent to the carbonyl carbon of the 
mixed anhydride intermediate. 
GlnRS is among a small number of aaRS systems for which such a detailed level of structural characterization is available (reviewed in Perona 2005; Perona & Hadd 2012). 
In addition, a crystal structure of unliganded *E. coli* GlnRS reveals that the active site is in an inactive conformation, explaining why tRNA is required for synthesis of
glutaminyl adenylate and revealing pathways for how tRNA binding helps to assemble the active site (Sherlin and Perona, 2003).


## Editing


GlnRS lacks the post-transfer editing domain found in Class I IleRS, LeuRS and ValRS, and does not require editing to discriminate against noncognate amino acids. 
However, kinetic measurements using a modified tRNA$^\text{Gln}$, in which the 2'-OH of A76 is substituted with 2'H, showed that the synthetic active site of the enzyme catalyzes 
the hydrolysis of Gln-AMP to form Gln and AMP, a reaction analogous to pre-transfer editing of misactivated amino acids by other aaRS, such as IleRS (Gruic-Sovulj et al., 2005). 


## Non-translational functions

Human GlnRS interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 and inhibits apoptosis (Ko et al., 2001). This interaction and the subsequent prevention of cell death is regulated by the intracellular concentration of glutamine (Ko et al., 2001).


## Clinical significance

Mutations in QARS1 have been associated with developmental epileptic encephalopathy (Johannesen et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2022) as well as other abnormalities of the central nervous system and/or senses (Fuchs et al., 2018). 

With the exception of certain human parasites like Leishmania (Nabholz et al., 1994), there is no mitochondrial GlnRS in eukaryotes (including humans). Instead, mitochondrial Gln-tRNA$^\text{Gln}$ is produced through the non-discriminating GlxRS, coupled with a transamidation pathway (Schön et al., 1988, Frechin et al., 2009, Nagao et al. 2009, Echevarria et al. 2014).
