Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid glutamine to its cognate tRNA:


$ \text{Gln} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlnRS}} \text{Gln-tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $


As discussed by Hadd and Perona 2014, there is a complex coevolutionary history between glutamyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases, which comprise subclass Ib (Perona and Hadd. 2012, Gomez et al., 2020). 
Their diversification occurred after the last universal common ancestor, with bacterial-like forms being characterized by an $\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain, and the archaeal and eukaryotic forms possessing a $\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain.
While many contemporary systems express both GlnRS and GluRS, their ancestor was most likely a non-discriminating form, which would attach Glu to tRNA$^\text{Gln}$.
A second enzymatic step, performed by an amidotransferase, would correct the misacylated tRNA prior to protein synthesis, as it does with [AsxRS](/class2/asp2/)  (Lapointe et al. 1986, Raczniak et al. 2001).
This non-discriminating enzyme is still found in systems which lack GlnRS, such the archaea, which express [GlxRS-A](/class1/glu2/), as well as certain bacteria which have a non-discriminating variant [GlxRS-B](/class1/glu1/),  or a noncognate variant GluGlnRS which attaches Glu to tRNA$^\text{Gln}$ (Salazar et al. 2003, Skouloubris et al. 2003).
It is likely that GlnRS originated in the eukaryota, and was later acquired by certain bacteria through horizontal gene transfer (Siatecka et al. 1998). 


The N-terminal catalytic domain of GlnRS closely resembles that of [GluRS-B](/class1/glu1/) , [GluRS-E](/class1/glu3/), and [GlxRS-A](/class1/glu2/) , 
constituting subclass Ib (Perona  and Hadd 2012, Gomez et al., 2020).
Their catalytic domains are characterized by an insertion within CP1, containing a loop flanked by two helices (SC1b IM), which 
may play a role in acceptor stem recognition  (Rath et al. 1998, Nureki et al. 2010).
Its [$\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_EQ)  is located at the C-terminal end (Rould et al. 1991) and is homologous with that of GlxRS-A and GluRS-E.
However it is distinct to the bacterial form GluRS-B, which instead has an [$\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_EK).
Members of subclass Ib, alongside [ArgRS](/class1/arg/) and  [LysRS-I](/class1/lys/), require the presence of tRNA to catalyze activation of the amino acid substrate (Dubois et al. 2005).




In many eukaryotes, the N-terminal contains a helical domain homologous to the Yqey domain found in amidotransferases (Hadd et al. 2014), and is required
for the assembly of the MARS complex (Kim et al. 2000).
It may also contribute to the enzyme's ability to discriminate against tRNA$^\text{Glu}$ (Hadd et al. 2014).
