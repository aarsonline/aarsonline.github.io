Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid glutamine to its cognate tRNA:


$ \text{Gln} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlnRS}} \text{Gln-tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



As discovered by Lamour and Mirande and discussed more recently by Hadd and Perona 2014, there is a complex coevolutionary history between glutamyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases (the GlxRS family), which comprise subclass Ib (Lamour et al., 1994, Perona and Hadd. 2012, Gomez et al., 2020). 
Their diversification occurred after the last universal common ancestor, with bacterial-like forms being characterized by an [$\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_EK), and the archaeal and eukaryotic forms possessing a [$\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_EQ) (Satiecka et al., 1998). Phylogeny strongly suggests that GlnRS originated in the eukaryota, and was later only acquired by certain bacteria, but never by archaea (Tumbula et al., 2000) through horizontal gene transfer (Lamour et al. 1994). Therefore, all eukaryotes express both GlnRS and GluRS, while all archaea and more than 90% of bacterial species studied thus far do not encode a GlnRS gene. When absent, GlnRS is replaced by a 2-step transamidation pathway involving a non-discriminating form of GluRS that attaches Glu to tRNA$^\text{Gln}$. A second enzymic step, performed by an tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (AdT), will amidate the misacylated Glu attached to tRNAGln into Gln prior to protein synthesis (Wilcox and Nirenberg, 1968, Sch√∂n et al., 1988, Curnow et al., 1997), as it does with [AsxRS](/class2/asp2/) (Becker et al., 1998). This non-discriminating enzyme is thus found in all organisms that lack GlnRS, such as all archaea, which express [GlxRS-A](/class1/glu2/), as well as the majority of bacteria which have a non-discriminating variant [GlxRS-B](/class1/glu1/) (Lapointe et al., 1986), or more rarely the noncognate variant GluGlnRS which only attaches Glu to tRNA$^\text{Gln}$  and not to tRNA$^\text{Glu}$ (Skouloubris et al. 2003, Salazar et al. 2003). 





## Structure


The N-terminal catalytic domain of GlnRS closely resembles that of [GluRS-B](/class1/glu1/) , [GluRS-E](/class1/glu3/), and [GlxRS-A](/class1/glu2/) , 
constituting subclass Ib (Perona  and Hadd 2012, Gomez et al., 2020).
Their catalytic domains are characterized by an insertion within CP1, containing a loop flanked by two helices (SC1b IM), which 
may play a role in acceptor stem recognition  (Rath et al. 1998, Nureki et al. 2010).
Its $\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain is located at the C-terminal end (Rould et al. 1991) and is homologous with that of GlxRS-A and GluRS-E.
However it is distinct to the bacterial form GluRS-B, which instead has an $\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain.
Members of subclass Ib, alongside [ArgRS](/class1/arg/) and  [LysRS-I](/class1/lys/), require the presence of tRNA to catalyze activation of the amino acid substrate (Dubois et al. 2005).




In many eukaryotes, the N-terminal contains a helical domain homologous to the Yqey domain found in amidotransferases (Hadd et al. 2014), and is required
for the assembly of the MARS complex (Kim et al. 2000).
It may also contribute to the enzyme's ability to discriminate against tRNA$^\text{Glu}$ (Hadd et al. 2014).

## Clinical significance



There is no mitochondrial GlnRS in humans. Instead mitochondrial Gln-tRNA$^\text{Gln}$ is produced through the non-discriminating GlxRS, coupled with a transmidation pathway (Echevarria et al. 2014, Nagao et al. 2009).
