Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid isoleucine to its cognate tRNA:

$ \text{Ile} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Ile} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{IleRS}} \text{Ile-tRNA}^\text{Ile} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $

IleRS features an N-terminal Rossmann fold catalytic domain, several C-terminal tRNA binding domains, and a post-transfer editing domain inserted between 
the two halves of the Rossmann fold (Nureki et al., 1998)

## Structure

IleRS is closely related to the [LeuRS-A](/class1/leu2), [LeuRS-B](/class1/leu1), [ValRS](/class1/val), [MetRS](/class1/met), and [CysRS](/class1/cys) families, which comprise 
subclass Ia (Perona and Hadd 2012, Gomez and Ibba, 2020, Douglas et al. 2023).
Most members of subclass Ia are characterized by their hydrophobic amino acid substrates, as well as the connecting peptide 2 (CP2) and zinc finger (ZF) insertions, depicted below. 
CP2 is a 30-40 amino acid two-helix bundle on the surface of the catalytic domain (Starzyk et al. 1987) and appears to be essential for amino acid activation (Zhou at al. 2008). 
Upstream from this resides a cysteine-rich zinc finger, 20-40 amino acids in length, also essential for effective aminoacylation (Nureki et al. 1993, Sugiura et al. 2000). 
IleRS, ValRS, and the bacterial-like LeuRS-B are further characterized by connecting peptide 3 (CP3), which contains a second zinc-finger motif in certain organisms (Fukunaga et al. 2005).
Its functional role is unclear. 


There are two types of IleRS, which have distinct sequences and C-terminal domain architectures. 
Both forms possess a  [helical domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_CRIMVL), that recognizes the anticodon loop, residing C-terminal to the catalytic domain.
This helical domain is universal across the members of subclass Ia, and is also found in [ArgRS](/class1/arg).
However, the remaining C-terminal regions vary between the two IleRS types.
The first type, IleRS-1, is found in certain bacteria, organelles, and eukaryotic cytosols.
It possesses a [C-terminal junction domain](/superfamily/class1/C-terminal_junction_domain) and a zinc finger downstream from the helical bundle.
Together with an N-terminal extension, the three C-terminal domains recognise the anticodon loop (Silvian et al. 1999).  
The second type, IleRS-2, is found in many archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotic cytosols. 
It lacks the N-terminal extension and zinc finger motif (Brkic et al. 2023), and achieves anticodon loop recognition through a much larger variation of the C-terminal junction domain.



Most X-ray crystallographic work on IleRS has focused on enzymes from the domain Bacteria. However, a structure of the enzyme from a eukaryotic enzyme is of interest because bacterial IleRS from pathogenic organisms are targets for the development of pharmaceuticals. The crystal structure of Candida albicans IleRS showed structural differences compared to the bacterial enzyme, in both signature Class I AARS motifs (HIGH and KMSKS) found in the active site (Chung et al., 2020). The authors suggest that the more compact active site of the eukaryotic enzyme plays an important role in the resistance of this enzyme to anti-infective agents. The resistance of the bacterium *Staphylococcus aureus* to antibiotics targeting IleRS is also due to alterations in the HIGH motif (Brkic et al., 2023).


## Editing

IleRS, LeuRS, and ValRS share a a post-transfer [editing domain](/superfamily/class1/Editing_domain_1a) inserted between the two halves of the Rossmann fold, which is absent from the Class Ia MetRS and CysRS enzymes. 
The post-transfer editing domain enhances amino acid selectivity by catalyzing the hydrolysis of misacylated amino acids. 
In the case of IleRS, significant misacylation requiring post-transfer editing occurs for both valine and norvaline (Bilus et al., 2019; Gomez and Ibba, 2020). 
Post-transfer editing defines the "double sieve" selectivity mechanism of certain AARS enzymes, including IleRS, against noncognate amino acids.
 The structural mechanism of post-transfer editing involves translocation of the single-stranded 3'-end of the misacylated tRNA from 
 the synthetic site to the post-transfer editing site in the inserted editing domain (Silvian et al., 1999).


In IleRS, tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing of misactivated Val-AMP plays a significant role in establishing selectivity against valine. 
This reaction is important because the mechanistic rate constant for transfer of Val to tRNA$^\text{Ile}$ is unusually slow, allowing effective competition by an active-site water molecule (Dulic et al. 2010, 2014). 
In contrast, ValRS-catalyzed transfer of noncognate threonine to tRNA$^\text{Val}$ is rapid, so that editing by ValRS is accomplished almost entirely by the post-transfer reaction. 
The rate of tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing by IleRS is not sensitive to mutations in the inserted editing domain that inactivate post-transfer editing, 
demonstrating that this activity occurs in the synthetic active site (Dulic et al., 2010). 
A conserved tyrosine in the synthetic active site modulates the efficiency of both the synthesis and editing reactions (Dulic et al., 2014). 


## Non-translational functions


## Clinical significance



Biallelic recessive (homozygous and compound heterozygous) variants in the human gene IARS2 encoding the mitochondrial IleRS cause Leigh syndrome or a phenotype including cataracts, growth hormone deficiency with short stature, partial sensorineural deafness, and peripheral neuropathy (firstly reported in Schwartzentruber et al. 2014). The exhaustive list of disease-related variants (including location on the sequence and structure, the conservation of the affected residues, and the related references) can be found [here](http://misynpat.org/misynpat/PageMaker.rvt?name=IARS2). Mutations have been mapped to all domains of the mt-IleRS, except to the terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS).



Antibiotic resistance for *Staphylococcus aureus* is conferred by mutations in IleRS  (Brkic et al., 2023).
