Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid isoleucine to its cognate tRNA:





$ \text{Ile} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Ile} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{IleRS}} \text{Ile-tRNA}^\text{Ile} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $


IleRS features a N-terminal catalytic domain, C-terminal tRNA binding domains, and a post-transfer editing domain inserted within the catalytic domain (Nordin and Schimmel 2005).


## Structure

IleRS is closely related to the [LeuRS-A](/class1/leu2), [LeuRS-B](/class1/leu1), [ValRS](/class1/val), and [MetRS](/class1/met) families, which comprise 
subclass Ia (Perona and Hadd 2012, Gomez and Ibba, 2020).
Members of subclass Ia are characterized by their hydrophobic amino acid substrates, as well as the connecting peptide 2 (CP2) and zinc finger (ZF) insertions, depicted below. 
CP2 is a 30-40 amino acid two-helix bundle on the surface of the catalytic domain (Starzyk et al. 1987) and appears to be essential for amino acid activation (Zhou at al. 2008). 
Upstream from this resides a cysteine-rich zinc finger, 20-40 amino acids in length, also essential for effective aminoacylation (Nureki et al. 1993, Sugiura et al. 2000). 
IleRS, ValRS, and the bacterial-like LeuRS-B are further characterized by connecting peptide 3 (CP3), which contains a second zinc-finger motif in certain organisms (Fukunaga et al. 2005).
Its functional role is unclear. 


There are two types of IleRS, which have distinct sequences and C-terminal domain architectures. 
Both forms possess a  [helical domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_CRIMVL), that recognises the anticodon loop, residing downstream from the catalytic domain.
The domain is universal across the members of subclass Ia, as well as [CysRS](/class1/cys) and [ArgRS](/class1/arg).
However, the remaining C-terminal regions vary between the two types.
The first type, IleRS-1, is found in certain bacteria, organelles, and eukaryotic cytosols.
It possesses a [C-terminal junction domain](/superfamily/class1/C-terminal_junction_domain) and a zinc finger downstream from the helical bundle.
Together with an N-terminal extension, the three C-terminal domains recognise the anticodon loop (Silvian et al. 1999).  
The second type, IleRS-2, is found in many archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotic cytosols. 
It lacks the N-terminal extension and zinc finger motif (Brkic et al. 2023), and achieves anticodon loop recognition through a much larger variation of the C-terminal junction domain.



## Editing


IleRS, LeuRS, and ValRS share a a post-transfer [editing domain](/superfamily/class1/Editing_domain_1a), absent from MetRS.
The editing domain typically resides within the zinc finger, providing further amino acid selectivity by expelling a wide range of mistargetted amino acids 
such alanine, cysteine, threonine, valine, isoleucine, methionine, homocysteine, and norvaline (Gomez and Ibba, 2020).


## Non-translational functions


## Clinical significance


Certain bacteria, such as *Staphylococcus aureus*, have an abnormal GxHH sequence profile in place of the standard HxGH motif in IleRS-2, promoting antibiotic resistance (Brkic et al. 2023).

Recessive mutations in the human gene IARS2 encoding the mitochondrial IleRS cause Leigh syndrome or a phenotype including cataracts, growth hormone deficiency with short stature, partial sensorineural deafness, and peripheral neuropathy (firstly reported in Schwartzentruber et al. 2014).
