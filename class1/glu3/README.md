The cytosolic eukaryote-like glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS-E) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in cytosolic protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid glutamate to its cognate tRNA:


$ \text{Glu} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Glu} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GluRS-E}} \text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Glu} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $






As discovered by Lamour and Mirande in 1994 and discussed more recently by Hadd and Perona 2014, the glutamyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases comprising subclass Ib (Lamour et al., 1994, Perona and Hadd 2012, Gomez et al., 2020), have a complex complex coevolutionary history. Their diversification occurred after the last universal common ancestor, with bacterial-like forms being characterized by an $\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain, and the archaeal and eukaryotic forms possessing a $\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain (Satiecka et al., 1998). Phylogeny strongly suggests that GlnRS originated in the eukaryota, and was only later acquired by certain bacteria, but never by archaea (Tumbula et al., 2000) through horizontal gene transfer (Lamour et al. 1994). Therefore, all eukaryotes express forms of both GlnRS and GluRS, while all archaea and more than 90% of bacterial species studied thus far do not possess a GlnRS-encoding gene. 





GluRS-E is a discriminating form of GluRS found in many eukaryotic cytosols, and is characterized by an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase ([GST](/d/gst)) domain (Simader et al., 2006). However, in the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisisae* it can be imported into mitochondria where it generates the mitochondrial Glu-tRNA$^\text{Gln}$ that is transamidated by a mitochondrial GatFAB AdT enzyme to produce the correctly acylated Gln-tRNA$^\text{Gln}$ (Frechin et al., 2009).
In most animals, including humans, glutamyl-tRNA is produced by a fusion protein glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) (Cerini et al., 1991, Berthonneau et al. 2000). 
EPRS contains the catalytic domains from both GluRS-E and [ProRS-A](/class2/pro1/), as well as the ProRS-A zinc binding domain, and the GluRS GST domain. 
Glutamic acid is a metabolic precursor for proline, which suggests a possible explanation for the origin of this protein (Eswarappa et al. 2018). In addition, in mammals, EPRS is a component of the multisynthetase complex (MSC) (Bandyopadhyay and Deutscher, 1971) composed of 9 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (7 mono-functional AARS and the bi-functional EPRS) and 3 AARS-Interacting Multifunctional Proteins (AIMPs: AIMP1 or P43; AIMP2 or P38; and AIMP3 or P18 )(Mirande et al., 1982, Park et al., 2005). 


## Structure

The N-terminal catalytic domain of GluRS-E closely resembles the other members of subclass Ib: [GlnRS](/class1/gln/), [GluRS-B](/class1/glu1/), GlxRS-A,  and GlxRS-B.
These catalytic domains are characterized by an insertion within CP1, containing a loop flanked by two helices (SC1b IM), which 
may play a role in acceptor stem recognition  (Rath et al. 1998, Nureki et al. 2010).
GluRS-E has a $\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain located at the C-terminal end (Rould et al. 1991), which is homologous to GlxRS-A and GlnRS.
However, it is distinct from the bacterial form GluRS-B, which instead has an $\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain of bacterial origin. 
The members of subclass Ib, alongside [ArgRS](/class1/arg/) and  [LysRS-I](/class1/lys/), require the presence of tRNA to catalyze activation of the amino acid substrate (Dubois et al. 2005).
Chung et al. 2022 identified four potential regions of the *Gallus Gallus* GluRS-E which may provide selectivity against tRNA$^\text{Gln}$.

## Non-translational functions
In human cells, EPRS is part of the of the interferon (IFN)- gamma-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex involved in translational silencing of genes involved in inflammation (Sampath et al., 2004). It is also a mTOR-S6K1 effector that regulates long-chain fatty acid uptake (Arif et al., 2017). All these noncanonical function of EPRS are regulated by posttranslational modification of the WHEP domains of EPRS (Jia et al., 2008).


## Clinical significance


The human EPRS gene is involved in autosomal recessive hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 15 (HLD15), which is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations (Mendes et al. 2018).
