The eukaryote-like glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS-E) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid glutamate to its cognate tRNA:


$ \text{Glu} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Glu} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GluRS-E}} \text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Glu} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $






As discovered by Lamour and Mirande and discussed more recently by Hadd and Perona 2014, there is a complex coevolutionary history between glutamyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases (the GlxRS family), which comprise subclass Ib (Lamour et al., 1994, Perona and Hadd. 2012, Gomez et al., 2020). 
Their diversification occurred after the last universal common ancestor, with bacterial-like forms being characterized by an [$\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_EK), and the archaeal and eukaryotic forms possessing a [$\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_EQ) (Satiecka et al., 1998). Phylogeny strongly suggests that GlnRS originated in the eukaryota, and was later only acquired by certain bacteria, but never by archaea (Tumbula et al., 2000) through horizontal gene transfer (Lamour et al. 1994). Therefore, all eukaryotes express both GlnRS and GluRS, while all archaea and more than 90% of bacterial species studied thus far do not encode a GlnRS gene. When absent, GlnRS is replaced by a 2-step transamidation pathway involving a non-discriminating form of GluRS that attaches Glu to tRNA$^\text{Gln}$. A second enzymic step, performed by an tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (AdT), will amidate the misacylated Glu attached to tRNAGln into Gln prior to protein synthesis (Wilcox and Nirenberg, 1968, Sch√∂n et al., 1988, Curnow et al., 1997), as it does with [AsxRS](/class2/asp2/) (Becker et al., 1998). This non-discriminating enzyme is thus found in all organisms that lack GlnRS, such as all archaea, which express [GlxRS-A](/class1/glu2/), as well as the majority of bacteria which have a non-discriminating variant [GlxRS-B](/class1/glu1/) (Lapointe et al., 1986), or more rarely the noncognate variant GluGlnRS which only attaches Glu to tRNA$^\text{Gln}$  and not to tRNA$^\text{Glu}$ (Skouloubris et al. 2003, Salazar et al. 2003). 




This page details the eukaryote-like GluRS-E, which is a discriminating form of GluRS. 
It is found in many eukaryotic cytosols, and is characterized by an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase ([GST](/superfamily/class1/GST)) domain (Hadd and Perona. 2014).
In most animals, including humans, glutamyl-tRNA is produced by a fusion protien glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) (Berthonneau et al. 2000). 
EPRS contains the catalytic domains from both GluRS-E and [ProRS-A](/class2/pro1/), as well as the ProRS-A zinc binding domain, and the GluRS GST domain. 
Glutamic acid is a metabolic precursor for proline, which suggests a possible explanation for the origin of this protein (Eswarappa et al. 2018). 


## Structure

The N-terminal catalytic domain of GluRS-E closely resembles the other members of subclass Ib: [GlnRS](/class1/gln/), [GluRS-B](/class1/glu1/), GlxRS-A,  and GlxRS-B.
Their catalytic domains are characterized by an insertion within CP1, containing a loop flanked by two helices (SC1b IM), which 
may play a role in acceptor stem recognition  (Rath et al. 1998, Nureki et al. 2010).
GluRS-E has a $\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain located at the C-terminal end (Rould et al. 1991), which is homologous to GlxRS-A and GlnRS.
However it is distinct to the bacterial form GluRS-B, which instead has an $\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain of bacterial origin. 
The members of subclass Ib, alongside [ArgRS](/class1/arg/) and  [LysRS-I](/class1/lys/), require the presence of tRNA to catalyze activation of the amino acid substrate (Dubois et al. 2005).
Chung et al. 2022 identified four potential regions of the *Gallus Gallus* GluRS-E which may offer selectivity against tRNA$^\text{Gln}$.
