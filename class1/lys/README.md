The Class I lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS-I) is a monomeric enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid lysine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Lys} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Lys} + \text{Lys} \xrightarrow{\text{LysRS-I}} \text{Lys-tRNA}^\text{Lys} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $




The Class I LysRS is present in most archaea and some bacteria, but to date has not been found in eukaryotes. Most organisms instead have a [Class II LysRS](/class2/lys). These two forms of LysRS arose through convergent evolution (Terada et al. 2002). 




## Structure

The C-terminal [anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_EK) is &alpha;-helical rich and similar to [GluRS](/class1/glu1) (Terada et al. 2002).  Lysine activation and recognition by Class I LysRS is tRNA-dependent, an attribute of several class I, but not class II, synthetases.
However, the catalytic domain is not immediately related to any other Class I synthetases, and as such, the enzyme belongs to its own subclass d (Douglas et al. 2023). 
Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the backbone brackets (Kaiser et al. 2018). 
The catalytic domain is characterized by the $\beta$-rich LysRS-I insertion module. Its functional role remains unclear.

## Non-translational functions

Unlike the Class II LyRS, the class I form is not capable of synthesizing the alarmone Ap4A.
