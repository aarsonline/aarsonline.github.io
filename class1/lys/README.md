The Class I lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS-I) is a monomeric enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid arginine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Lys} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Lys} + \text{Lys} \xrightarrow{\text{LysRS-I}} \text{Lys-tRNA}^\text{Lys} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $




The C-terminal [anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_EK) is &alpha;-helical rich and similar to [GluRS](/class1/glu1) (Terada et al. 2002). 
However, the catalytic domain is not immediately related to any other Class I synthetases, and as such, the enzyme belongs to its own subclass d (Douglas et al. 2023).
Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the backbone brackets (Kaiser et al. 2018). 
The catalytic domain is characterized by the $\beta$-rich LysRS-I insertion module. Its functional role remains unclear. 
Editing activity has not been characterized for LysRS-I (Gomez and Ibba, 2020).  

The Class I LysRS is present in most archaea and some bacteria. Whereas, eukaryotes and most bacteria instead have a [Class II LysRS](/class2/lys). 
These two variants arose through convergent evolution (Terada et al. 2002).
