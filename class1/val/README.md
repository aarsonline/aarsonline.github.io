Valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of valine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Val} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Val} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{ValRS}} \text{Val-tRNA}^\text{Val} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



In lower eukaryotes, ValRS is among a small subgroup of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (together with [AlaRS](/class2/ala), [GlyRS](/class2/gly3), and [HisRS](/class2/his) Chatton et al. 1986)) that operate in both the cytosol and the mitochondria.
Phylogenetic analyses suggest that, in eukaryotes, the cytosolic ValRS arose by horizontal transfer from mitochondria, and is therefore of bacterial origin (Brown et a. 1995).
Thus, the archaeal form of ValRS stands apart from the rest of the family.


ValRS features an N-terminal Rossmann fold catalytic domain, several C-terminal tRNA binding domains, and a post-transfer editing domain inserted between the two halves of the Rossmann fold (Fukai et al., 2000; Nureki and Yokoyama, 2005).

## Structure


ValRS is closely related to the [LeuRS-A](/class1/leu2), [LeuRS-B](/class1/leu1), [IleRS](/class1/ile), [MetRS](/class1/met), and [CysRS](/class1/cys) families families, which comprise 
subclass Ia (Perona and Hadd 2012, Gomez and Ibba, 2020, Douglas et al. 2023). Members of subclass Ia are characterized by their hydrophobic amino acid substrates, as well as the connecting peptide 2 (CP2) and zinc finger (ZF) insertions, depicted below. 
CP2 is a 30-40 amino acid two-helix bundle on the surface of the catalytic domain (Starzyk et al. 1987) and appears to be essential for amino acid activation (Zhou et al. 2008). 
Upstream from this resides a cysteine-rich zinc finger, 20-40 amino acids in length, also essential for effective aminoacylation (Nureki et al. 1993, Sugiura et al. 2000). 
ValRS, IleRS, and the bacterial-like LeuRS-B are further characterized by connecting peptide 3 (CP3), which contains a second zinc-finger motif in certain organisms (Fukunaga et al. 2005).
Its functional role is unclear. 


The anticodon loop is recognised by three C-terminal domains.
The first is a [helical domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_CRIMVL), universal across the members of subclass Ia, as well as [ArgRS](/class1/arg).
The second is an [$\alpha$/$\beta$ domain](/superfamily/class1/C-terminal_junction_domain) that recognizes the anticodon stem (Fukai et al. 2000, Fukai et al. 2003).
Lastly, a coiled coil recognizes the D-loop of the tRNA (Fukai et al. 2000), however this domain is absent in archaea.





## Editing

ValRS,	IleRS, and LeuRS share a post-transfer [editing domain](/superfamily/class1/Editing_domain_1a), absent from MetRS and CysRS.
This editing domain is inserted between the two halves of the Rossmann fold, and enhances amino acid selectivity by catalyzing the hydrolysis of misacylated amino acids (Fukunaga and Yokoyama, 2006; Gomez and Ibba, 2020).
In the case of ValRS, significant misacylation requiring post-transfer editing is most important for noncognate threonine (Fersht and Kaethner, 1976), and also been shown for norvaline (Bilus et al., 2019). 
Post-transfer editing defines the "double sieve" selectivity mechanism of certain aaRS enzymes, including ValRS, against noncognate amino acids. The structural mechanism of post-transfer editing involves translocation of the single-stranded 3'-end of the misacylated $\text{Thr-tRNA}^\text{Val}$ from the synthetic site to the post-transfer editing site in the inserted editing domain (Silvian et al., 1999). 


Like IleRS, ValRS is able to catalyze pre-transfer editing: the ValRS synthetic site in the Rossmann fold domain has the distinct additional capacity to catalyze hydrolysis of misactivated Thr-AMP. However, in ValRS the rate constant for transfer of misactivated Thr to $\text{tRNA}^\text{Val}$ is much larger than the rate constant for this hydrolytic reaction. Hence, pre-transfer editing plays little to no role in ValRS editing, and the rejection of Thr instead occurs almost entirely by post-transfer editing in the spatially separate editing hydrolytic site (Dulic et al., 2010). By contrast, in IleRS these two rate constants are similar in magnitude, so both pre-transfer and post-transfer editing are important in that enzyme.




## Non-translational functions



## Clinical significance

Biallelic recessive variants (homozygous and compound heterozygous) in the human gene VARS1 encoding the cytosolic ValRS lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, seizures, and cortical atrophy (NDMSCA) (First described in Karaca et al 2015). 

Biallelic recessive variants (homozygous and compound heterozygous) in the human gene VARS2 encoding the mitochondrial ValRS cause a phenotype including mitochondrial encephalo-cardiomyopathy (firstly reported in Taylor et al. 2014). The exhaustive list of disease-causing variants of mt-ValRS (including location on sequence and structure, the conservation of affected residues, and the related references) can be found [here](http://misynpat.org/misynpat/PageMaker.rvt?name=VARS2). Mutations have been mapped to all the domains of mt-ValRS except the N-terminal mitochondrial targetting sequence (MTS).
