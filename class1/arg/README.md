Arginyl-tRNA synthetase (ArgRS) is a monomeric enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalysing the attachment of the amino acid arginine to its cognate tRNA:



$ \text{Arg} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Arg} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{ArgRS}} \text{Arg-tRNA}^\text{Arg} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $


## Structure


In contrast to the mode of action of most Class I and II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, ArgRS requires the presence of its cognate $\text{tRNA}^\text{Arg}$ for effective arginine activation (Mitra et al. 1967, Eriani and Cavarelli 2005).
tRNA binding is coordinated by the N- and C-terminal domains, which are adjacent in the tertiary structure (Cavarelli et al. 1998). 
The N-terminal domain is a two layer &alpha;/&beta; unit that recognises the D-loop, and the C-terminal domain is a four helix bundle that recognises the anticodon. 
Structural and mutation studies suggest that the interaction between the N-terminal domain and the D-loop is not stable, and deletion of the N-terminal domain has only a small effect on tRNA aminoacylation activity (Konno et al. 2009).
 Furthermore,  the orientation of this domain relative to the catalytic domain also varies across structures (Shimada et al.2001). 
The N-terminal domain is characteristic of ArgRS and is lacking in other Class I structures, while the C-terminal [anticodon binding domain](/d/crimvlg) is also found in
[CysRS](/class1/cys), [LeuRS](/class1/leu1), [ValRS](/class1/val), [MetRS](/class1/met), and [IleRS](/class1/ile).
ArgRS charges tRNAs that correspond to six different codons. In the standard genetic code, leucine and serine are the only other amino acids which are encoded by six codons.




The catalytic domain of ArgRS is typical of a Class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, with a four-stranded Rossmann fold.  Arginine binding in the active site is coordinated by two salt bridges (with two acidic residues) and one hydrogen bond (with a tyrosine) and these three residues are strongly conserved in ArgRS (Cavarelli et al. 1998). Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the backbone brackets (Kaiser et al. 2018). ArgRS is characterised by a bundle of $\alpha$ helices after the HIGH motif - the ArgRS insertion module (Cavarelli et al. 1998, Douglas et al. 2023). The number of helices in the bundle is variable. 
The catalytic domain is not immediately related to any other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and as such, ArgRS falls into its own subclass, Ie (Douglas et al. 2023). 





Under normal conditions, ArgRS is monomeric just like most Class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Kim et al. 2014).
However, heme binding induces ArgRS dimerization in *Plasmodium falciparum*, rendering the enzyme inactive (Jain et al. 2016).
Moreover, in some archaea, ArgRS assembles into a complex with [SerRS](/class2/ser1), which has been reported to increase the efficiency of SerRS under extreme conditions (Godinic-Mikulcic et al. 2011). 



## Editing

There is no editing activity in ArgRS (Gomez and Ibba 2020).



## Non-translational functions
Human cytosolic ArgRS has been found to translocate to the cell nucleus in response to changing levels of its metabolite arginine and to mediate alternative, non-translational functions (Cui et al. 2023). 


## Clinical significance

Homozygous and compound heterozygous variants in human RARS1 encoding the cytosolic ArgRS are associated with Hypomyelinating Leukodystrophy, a white matter brain disorder. Mutations have been mapped to all domains of ArgRS, with the most prevalent ones found in the N-terminal leucine zipper (Wolf et al. 2014; Nafisinia et al. 2017; Mendes et al. 2020).   

Biallelic recessive variants in the human gene RARS2 encoding the mitochondrial ArgRS cause the brain disease Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6 (PCH6) (firstly described in Edvardson et al. 2007). The exhaustive list of PCH6-related variants of RARS2 (including location on the sequence and on the stucture, the conservation of the affected residues, and the related references) can be found [here](http://misynpat.org/misynpat/PageMaker.rvt?name=RARS2). Mutations have been mapped to all domains of the mt-ArgRS except in the N-terminal tRNA-edge binding domain.
