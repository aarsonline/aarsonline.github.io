The bacterial-like leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS-B) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of leucine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Leu} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Leu} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{LeuRS-B}} \text{Leu-tRNA}^\text{Leu} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $


## Structure

LeuRS-B is found in most bacteria and organelles, and differs from the archaeal-like form [LeuRS-A](/class1/leu2), which is found in most archaea (Lincecum and Martinis, 2005).
Either type may reside in a eukaryotic cytosol.   The two forms are characterized by their abilities to charge tRNAs corresponding to six leucine codons.
In the standard genetic code, [ArgRS](/class1/arg) and [SerRS](/class2/ser1) are the only other AARS which decode as many as six codons.
The structures of LeuRS-A and -B are distinguished by 
i) the placement of the editing domain within their primary sequence  (Fukunaga et al. 2005), 
ii) the C-terminal domain which recognises tRNA (Tukalo et al. 2005), and 
iii) the LeuRS-B insertion module (shown below), also known as the leucyl-specific domain (Cusack et al. 2000).
Crystal structures of bacterial LeuRS are available to provide structural correlates for all three reactions catalyzed by the enzyme: Leu-AMP formation, synthesis of \text{Leu-tRNA}^\text{Leu}  and post-transfer editing of misacylated \text{tRNA}^\text{Leu}  species (Cusack et al., 2000; Tukalo et al., 2005; Palencia et al, 2012; Pang et al., 2022).


LeuRS-A and -B alike are closely related to the  [IleRS](/class1/ile), [ValRS](/class1/val), [MetRS](/class1/met), and [CysRRS](/class1/cys) families, which comprise 
subclass Ia (Perona and Hadd 2012, Gomez and Ibba, 2020, Douglas et al. 2023).
Members of subclass Ia are characterized by their hydrophobic amino acid substrates, as well as the connecting peptide 2 (CP2) and zinc finger (ZF) insertions, depicted below. 
CP2 is a 30-40 amino acid two-helix bundle on the surface of the catalytic domain (Starzyk et al. 1987) and appears to be essential for amino acid activation (Zhou et al. 2008). 
Upstream from this resides a cysteine-rich zinc finger, 20-40 amino acids in length, also essential for effective aminoacylation (Nureki et al. 1993, Sugiura et al. 2000). 
IleRS, ValRS, and LeuRS-B are further characterized by connecting peptide 3 (CP3), which contains a second zinc-finger motif in certain organisms (Fukunaga et al. 2005).
Its functional role is unclear. 


The tRNA is recognised by two C-terminal domains (Tukalo et al. 2005, Rock et al. 2007).
The first is a  [helical domain](/d/crimvl) that recognises the anticodon, and is universal across the members of subclass Ia plus ArgRS.
The second is a compact $\alpha$-$\beta$ domain unique to LeuRS-B.
The domain is flexibly linked with the rest of the protein and mutational studies suggest it is essential for effective aminoacylation (Tukalo et al. 2005).



## Editing


IleRS, LeuRS, and ValRS share a a post-transfer [editing domain](/d/edit1a) inserted between the two halves of the Rossmann fold, which is absent from the subclass Ia MetRS and CysRS enzymes. The post-transfer editing domain enhances amino acid selectivity by catalyzing the hydrolysis of misacylated amino acids. Interestingly, and unlike LeuRS-A, ValRS, and IleRS, the editing domain of LeuRS-B resides downstream of the zinc finger and CP2 (Fukunaga et al. 2005). Thus, the domain appears to have hopped between the two positions, or may have originated as a trans-acting factor.

 In LeuRS, post-transfer editing is best characterized for hydrolysis of misacylated norvaline, $\text{Nva-tRNA}^\text{Leu}$ (Bilus et al., 2019; Dulic et al., 2018; Cvetesic et al., 2012). Detailed kinetic analyses have shown that, like ValRS, LeuRS achieves fidelity against noncognate amino acids almost entirely at the post-transfer editing step. The efficiency of post-transfer editing is controlled by kinetic partitioning beteen hydrolysis and dissociation of the misacylated tRNA (Cvetesic et al., 2012).

## Clinical significance



Biallelic recessive (homozygous and compound heterozygous) variants in the human gene LARS2 encoding the mitochondrial leuRS cause the Perrault syndrome (firstly reported in Pierce et al. 2013). The exhaustive list of disease-causing variants (including location on the sequence and structure, the conservation of the affected residues, and the related references) can be found [here](http://misynpat.org/misynpat/PageMaker.rvt?name=LARS2). Mutations have been mapped to all domains of the mt-LeuRS except the C-terminal tRNA-edge binding domain.
The human LARS1 gene encoding cytosolic LeuRS is part of the archaeal-like LeuRS-A family.
