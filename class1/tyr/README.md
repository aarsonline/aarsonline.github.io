Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of tyrosine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Tyr} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Tyr} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{TyrRS}} \text{Tyr-tRNA}^\text{Tyr} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $




TyrRS shares a number of similarities with its close homolog [TrpRS](/class1/trp), which constitute subclass Ic.
TyrRS and TrpRS are homodimeric, in contrast to many Class I synthetases which operate as monomers (Gomez and Ibba, 2020).
Moreover, the two amino acids may have been among the last amino acids to emerge in the metabolism (Trifonov 2000), 
and are chemically similar (aromatic side chains), consistent with the hypotheses of the two AARS sharing a common ancestor with either dual specificity, or one synthetase spawning off the other (Doublié et al. 1995, Fournier et al. 2015).
Conserved aspartate side chains in the specificity determining helix (SDH) allow the respective enzymes to discriminate between tyrosine and tryptophan (Doublié et al. 1995).
Lastly, while most Class I synthetases approach the tRNA acceptor stem from the minor groove side, TyrRS and TrpRS alike instead approach the acceptor stem directly (de Pouplana and Schimmel 2001).




The N-terminal of TyrRS contains the Class I Rossman fold catalytic domain, presenting connecting peptide 1 (CP1) in its simplest form.
There are varying idiosyncratic domains at the C-terminus, which differ between the bacteria, archaea, and eukaryota (Bedouelle 2005).
First, tRNA recognition is achieved by the helical anticodon binding domain in bacteria and organelles (Zhang et al. 2005) and a 
distinct tRNA binding domain in the archaea and eukaryota (Wolf et al. 1999). 
The latter is homologous with the [anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_WY) of TrpRS.
Second, many eukaryotic TyrRS, including the human form, contain a C-terminal RNA binding domain homologous to EMAP (Yaremchuk et al. 2002). 
This domain is also found in some forms of [MetRS](/class1/met) and [PheRS](/class2/phe2) (Wolf et al. 1999), and is the [anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class2/Anticodon_binding_domain_DNK) of subclass IIb AARS.
Lastly, most bacterial and organellar TyrRS possess a C-terminal RNA binding domain, which belongs to the S4 superfamily (Aravind et al. 1999).


Editing activity has not been detected for TyrRS, which is one of the more promiscuous AARS with respect to amino acid recognition (Bedouelle 2005).
Coupled with the lack of cross-reactivity between TyrRS and tRNA$^\text{Tyr}$ between bacteria and archaea, this property has made TyrRS a favorable target for engineering unnatural amino acids into the genetic code (Kobayashi et al. 2003).



TyrRS is also one of several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases expressed by the mimiviruses (Abergel et al. 2007).
In some eukaryotes, notably parasites, TyrRS exists as a double length duplicated enzyme which forms an asymmetric pseudo-dimer, with catalytic activity confined to the N-terminal paralog of the catalytic domain (Larson et al. 2011).
