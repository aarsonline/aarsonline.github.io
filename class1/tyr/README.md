Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of tyrosine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Tyr} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Tyr} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{TyrRS}} \text{Tyr-tRNA}^\text{Tyr} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $




TyrRS is expressed by all living organisms and is one of several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases expressed by the mimiviruses (Abergel et al. 2007).




## Structure

TyrRS shares a number of similarities with its close homolog [TrpRS](/class1/trp), which constitute subclass Ic.
TyrRS and TrpRS are homodimeric, in contrast to many Class I synthetases which operate as monomers (Gomez and Ibba, 2020).
Moreover, the two amino acids may have been among the last amino acids to emerge in the metabolism (Trifonov 2000), 
and are chemically similar (aromatic side chains), consistent with the hypotheses of the two AARS sharing a common ancestor with either dual specificity, or one synthetase spawning off the other (Doublié et al. 1995, Fournier et al. 2015).
Conserved aspartate side chains in the specificity determining helix (SDH) allow the respective enzymes to discriminate between tyrosine and tryptophan (Doublié et al. 1995).
Lastly, while most Class I synthetases approach the tRNA acceptor stem from the minor groove side, TyrRS and TrpRS alike instead approach the acceptor stem directly (de Pouplana and Schimmel 2001).




The N-terminal of TyrRS contains the Class I Rossman fold catalytic domain, presenting connecting peptide 1 (CP1) in its simplest form.
There are varying idiosyncratic domains at the C-terminus, which differ between the bacteria, archaea, and eukaryota (Bedouelle 2005).
First, tRNA recognition is achieved by the helical anticodon binding domain in bacteria and organelles (Zhang et al. 2005) and a 
distinct tRNA binding domain in the archaea and eukaryota (Wolf et al. 1999). 
The latter is homologous with the [anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_WY) of TrpRS.
Second, many eukaryotic TyrRS, including the human form, contain a C-terminal RNA binding domain homologous to EMAP (Yaremchuk et al. 2002). 
This domain is also found in some forms of [MetRS](/class1/met) and [PheRS](/class2/phe2) (Wolf et al. 1999), and is the [anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class2/Anticodon_binding_domain_DNK) of subclass IIb AARS.
Lastly, most bacterial and organellar TyrRS possess a C-terminal RNA binding domain, which belongs to the S4 superfamily (Aravind et al. 1999).



Normally, TyrRS ia a homodimer.
However in some parasites, TyrRS exists as a double length duplicated enzyme which forms an asymmetric pseudo-dimer, with catalytic activity confined to the N-terminal paralog of the catalytic domain (Larson et al. 2011). 




## Editing

Editing activity has not been detected for TyrRS, which remains one of the more promiscuous AARS with respect to amino acid recognition (Bedouelle 2005).
Coupled with the lack of cross-reactivity between TyrRS and tRNA$^\text{Tyr}$ between bacteria and archaea, this property has made TyrRS a favorable target for engineering unnatural amino acids into the genetic code (Kobayashi et al. 2003).


## Non-translational functions

Human cytoplasmic TyrRS was among the first aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to be discovered to have non-translational functions when it was found to stimulate angiogenesis (Wakasugi et al., 2002). Since then, many functions of TyrRS as a regulator of cellular stress response and signaling have been discovered. TyrRS translocates to the cell nucleus under cell stress and can protect against DNA damage (Wei et al., 2014) following acetylation at position K244 (Cao et al., 2017). In the cell nucleus, TyrRS can control the expression of genes regulating protein synthesis (Jones et al, 2023). Human TyrRS was also shown to bind the molecule resveratrole, leading to nuclear localization and PARP1 activation (Sajish et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2019). These effects of resveratrol on TyrRS have been associated with neurodegeneration (Jhanji et al., 2022). TyrRS further regulates actin bundling (Ermanoska et al., 2023) and can stimulate platelet production by mimicking inflammatory stress (Morodomi et al., 2022). 

## Clinical significance

Dominant mutations in YARS1 encoding the human cytosolic TyrRS are causative for Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (Jordanova et al. 2006). 

Biallelic recessive variants (homozygous and compound heterozygous) in the human gene YARS2 encoding the mitochondrial TyrRS cause a phenotype including Myopathy, Lactic Acidosis, Sideroblastic Anaemia 2 (MLASA2) (firstly reported in Riley et al. 2010). THe exhaustive list of disease-causing variants of mt-TyrRS (including location on the sequence and structure, the conservation of affected residues, and the related references) can be found [here](http://misynpat.org/misynpat/PageMaker.rvt?name=YARS2). Mutations have been mapped to all domains of the mt-TyrRS.
