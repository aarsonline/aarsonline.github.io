In E. coli, CysRS recognizes its cognate tRNA via the unusual U73 nucleotide in the single-stranded 3'-end of the molecule 
(Komatsoulis & Abelson, 1993). However, the crystal structure of the tRNA 3'-end bound in the 
active site shows that A76 occupies the position of substrate ATP, an artifact of the crystallization conditions. 
Because of this, a structural explanation for the unusual U73 specificity is not available. 
The detailed stereochemical alignment of reactive moieties in the active site has also not been realized for CysRS.

The tRNA structure was annotated by [tRNAviz](http://trna.ucsc.edu/tRNAviz/summary/) (Lin et al. 2019), with identity elements indicated as described by Gieg√© and Eriani, 2023.
