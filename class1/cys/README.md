Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalysing the attachment of cysteine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Cys} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{CysRS}} \text{Cys-tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $




Unlike many other AARS, CysRS does not require editing activity to attain its remarkable degree of specificity, and is able to discriminate against alanine and serine quite effectively (Fersht et al. 1979, Hou and Perona, 2005).
This is be explained by the use of zinc ions that coordinate cysteine binding, a mechanism facilitated by conserved side chains of cysteine and histidine residues in the active site (Newberry et al. 2002).
Anticodon loop recognition is achieved by the C-terminal $\alpha/\beta$ domain (Hauenstein et al. 2004).
This resides downstream from the  helical [anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_CRIMVL)(Hou and Perona, 2005), which is also found in [ArgRS](/class1/arg), [LeuRS](/class1/leu1), [ValRS](/class1/val), [MetRS](/class1/met), and [IleRS](/class1/ile).
In CysRS however, the helical domain is substantially smaller and recognises the anticodon and D stems, rather than the anticodon loop (Hauenstein et al. 2004).
Acceptor stem recognition may be further coordinated by a disordered module on the surface of the catalytic domain (Newberry et al. 2002) - the CysRS insertion module.





CysRS behaves as a monomer in some organisms, and as a homodimer in others (Motorin et al. 1997).
While eukaryotes typically possess distinct genes encoding cytosolic and mitochondrial CysRS, yeast produces both forms from a single CysRS gene using alternative transcription start sites (Nishimura et al. 2019). 
The enzyme is lacking in many methanogenic archaea, which instead utilise [SepRS](/class2/sep) to encode cysteine (Sauerwald et al. 2005).
