Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalysing the attachment of cysteine to its cognate tRNA:



$ \text{Cys} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{CysRS}} \text{Cys-tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



Unlike many other AARS, CysRS does not require editing  to maintain specificity against structurally similar amino acids, such as alanine and serine (Fersht et al. 1979, Newberry et al., 2002; Hou and Perona, 2005). Instead, specificity is mediated by  a zinc ion coordinated to the substrate cysteine sulfhydryl  and to \ sulfydryl and imidazole groups of conserved cysteine and histidine residues in the active site (Newberry et al. 2002). 



The crystal structure of the E. coli CysRS-tRNACys complex showed that anticodon loop recognition is mediated by a C-terminal α/β domain (Hauenstein et al. 2004). 
All three nucleotides of the GCA anticodon exhibit direct recognition by hydrogen-bonding and other favorable interactions with this domain, 
which becomes well-ordered only upon tRNA binding.  In E.coli, tRNA discrimination by CysRS also relies on indirect readout of the globular 
tertiary core of the enzyme, mediated by contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone at an unusual G15-G48 Levitt base-pair (Sherlin et al., 2000; Hauenstein et al., 2004).



CysRS functions as a monomer in some organismsand a homodimer in others (Motorin et al. 1997). 
While eukaryotes typically possess distinct genes encoding cytosolic and mitochondrial CysRS, 
yeast produces both forms from a single CysRS gene using alternative transcription start sites (Nishimura et al., 2019). 
The enzyme is lacking in many methanogenic archaea, which instead supply cysteine by a two-step pathway involving the use of 
 [SepRS ](/class2/sep) to synthesize a phosphoseryl-tRNA$^\text{Cys}$ intermediate (Sauerwald et al. 2005).
