Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalysing the attachment of cysteine to its cognate tRNA:



$ \text{Cys} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{CysRS}} \text{Cys-tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



CysRS is expressed by most organisms, across the three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.
However, the enzyme is lacking in many methanogenic archaea, which instead supply cysteine by a two-step pathway involving the use of 
 [SepRS ](/class2/sep) to synthesize a phosphoseryl-tRNA$^\text{Cys}$ intermediate (Sauerwald et al. 2005), followed by conversion of the phosphoseryl to a cysteinyl residue.
 Moreover, while eukaryotes typically possess distinct genes encoding cytosolic and mitochondrial CysRS, 
yeast produces both forms from a single CysRS gene using alternative transcription start sites (Nishimura et al., 2019). 



## Structure


CysRS functions as a monomer in some organisms and a homodimer in others (Motorin et al. 1997). 
The crystal structure of the E. coli CysRS-tRNA$^\text{Cys}$ complex showed that anticodon loop recognition is mediated by a C-terminal α/β domain (Hauenstein et al. 2004). 
All three nucleotides of the GCA anticodon exhibit direct recognition by hydrogen-bonding and other favorable interactions with this domain, 
which becomes well-ordered only upon tRNA binding.  In E.coli, tRNA discrimination by CysRS also relies on indirect readout of the globular 
tertiary core of the enzyme, mediated by contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone at an unusual G15-G48 Levitt base-pair (Sherlin et al., 2000; Hauenstein et al., 2004).
The α/β domain resides downstream from the [helical domain](/d/crimvlg) (Hou and Perona, 2005), 
which is also found in [ArgRS](/class1/arg), [LeuRS](/class1/leu1), [ValRS](/class1/val), [MetRS](/class1/met), and [IleRS](/class1/ile).
In CysRS however, the helical domain is substantially smaller and recognizes the anticodon and D stems, rather than the anticodon loop (Hauenstein et al. 2004).
Acceptor stem recognition may be further coordinated by a disordered module on the surface of the catalytic domain (Newberry et al. 2002).
This characteristic feature - the CysRS insertion module - is found only in CysRS (Douglas et al, 2023).


In many eukaryotes, including *homo sapiens*, a [GST-like domain](/d/gst) is added through the inclusion of exon 2, the corresponding splice isoform shows a tissue-specific expression pattern and is predominantly found in testis (Kim et al., 2000). 





## Editing

Unlike many other AARS, CysRS does not require editing to maintain specificity against structurally similar amino acids, such as alanine 
and serine (Fersht et al. 1979, Newberry et al., 2002; Hou and Perona, 2005). Instead, specificity is mediated by a zinc ion coordinated
 to the substrate cysteine sulfhydryl and to sulfhydryl and imidazole groups of conserved cysteine and histidine residues in the active site (Newberry et al. 2002). 


## Non-translational functions

Both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of CysRS catalyze the post-translational formation of cysteine hydropersulfides (CysS–(S)n–H formation), which may function as antioxidants, redox signaling intermediates, and metal ligands (Akaike et al., 2017). 

Human CysRS binds Toll-like receptor 2 via its UNE-C1 domain and can activate the immune response (Cho et al., 2020). The UNE-C1 domain is currently being explored as an immunoadjuvant to boost anti-tumor immunity (Cho et al., 2020). This pro-inflammatory function of CysRS has also been explored in Alzheimer's disease, where it drives neuro-inflammation (Qi et al., 2024). 
Human CysRS also activates AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) upon cysteine starvation (Yuan et al., 2021). 


Kim et al., 2000 showed that the GST-like splice variant reduced aminoacylation activity, but enabled the interaction between CysRS with the translation elongation factor-1γ (eEF1γ).

 
## Clinical significance

Homozygous and compound heterozygous variants in the human gene CARS1 encoding the cytosolic CysRS cause complex syndromes that include microcephaly, developmental delay, and brittle hair and nails (Kuo et al., 2019). The brittle-hair-and-nail phenotype most likely reflects the high cysteine content in human keratins. 

Biallelic recessive variants (homozygous and compound heterozygous) in the human gene CARS2 encoding the mitochondrial CysRS cause a phenotype of epileptic encephalopathy (first described in Hallmann et al., 2014). The exhaustive list of the disease-related variants (identified according to their sequence and structure particularities, and the conservation of the affected residues) can be found [here](http://misynpat.org/misynpat/PageMaker.rvt?name=CARS2) along with related references. Mutations have been mapped to all domains of the mt-CysRS.
