Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalysing the attachment of cysteine to its cognate tRNA:



$ \text{Cys} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{CysRS}} \text{Cys-tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



CysRS is expressed by most organisms, across the three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.
However, the enzyme is lacking in many methanogenic archaea, which instead supply cysteine by a two-step pathway involving the use of 
 [SepRS ](/class2/sep) to synthesize a phosphoseryl-tRNA$^\text{Cys}$ intermediate (Sauerwald et al. 2005).
 Moreover, while eukaryotes typically possess distinct genes encoding cytosolic and mitochondrial CysRS, 
yeast produces both forms from a single CysRS gene using alternative transcription start sites (Nishimura et al., 2019). 



## Structure


CysRS functions as a monomer in some organisms and a homodimer in others (Motorin et al. 1997). 
The crystal structure of the E. coli CysRS-tRNA$^\text{Cys}$ complex showed that anticodon loop recognition is mediated by a C-terminal α/β domain (Hauenstein et al. 2004). 
All three nucleotides of the GCA anticodon exhibit direct recognition by hydrogen-bonding and other favorable interactions with this domain, 
which becomes well-ordered only upon tRNA binding.  In E.coli, tRNA discrimination by CysRS also relies on indirect readout of the globular 
tertiary core of the enzyme, mediated by contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone at an unusual G15-G48 Levitt base-pair (Sherlin et al., 2000; Hauenstein et al., 2004).
The α/β domain resides downstream from the [helical domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_CRIMVL) (Hou and Perona, 2005), 
which is also found in [ArgRS](/class1/arg), [LeuRS](/class1/leu1), [ValRS](/class1/val), [MetRS](/class1/met), and [IleRS](/class1/ile).
In CysRS however, the helical domain is substantially smaller and recognizes the anticodon and D stems, rather than the anticodon loop (Hauenstein et al. 2004).
Acceptor stem recognition may be further coordinated by a disordered module on the surface of the catalytic domain (Newberry et al. 2002).
This characteristic feature - the CysRS insertion module - is only found in CysRS (Douglas et al, 2023).






## Editing

Unlike many other AARS, CysRS does not require editing  to maintain specificity against structurally similar amino acids, such as alanine 
and serine (Fersht et al. 1979, Newberry et al., 2002; Hou and Perona, 2005). Instead, specificity is mediated by  a zinc ion coordinated
 to the substrate cysteine sulfhydryl  and to sulfhydryl and imidazole groups of conserved cysteine and histidine residues in the active site (Newberry et al. 2002).

## Clinical significance

Biallelic recessive variants (homozygous and compound heterozygous) in the human gene CARS2 encoding the mitochondrial CysRS cause a phenotype of epileptic encephalopathy (firstly descrived in Hallmann et al., 2014). The exhaustive list of the disease-related variants (including location on the sequence and structure, the conservation of the affected residues, and the related references) can be found [here](http://misynpat.org/misynpat/PageMaker.rvt?name=CARS2). Mutations have been mapped to all domains of the mt-CysRS.
