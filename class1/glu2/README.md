The non-discriminating Archaeal-like glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GlxRS-A) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid glutamate to its cognate tRNA$^\text{Glu}$, as well as to tRNA$^\text{Gln}$. These reactions proceed through the following mechanisms:




$ \text{Glu} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Glu} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlxRS-A}} \text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Glu} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $


$ \text{Glu} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlxRS-A}} \text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $








As discovered by Lamour and Mirande and discussed more recently by Hadd and Perona 2014, there is a complex coevolutionary history between glutamyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases (the GlxRS family), which comprise subclass Ib (Lamour et al., 1994, Perona and Hadd. 2012, Gomez et al., 2020). 
Their diversification occurred after the last universal common ancestor, with bacterial-like forms being characterized by an [$\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain](/d/ek), and the archaeal and eukaryotic forms possessing a [$\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain](/d/eq) (Satiecka et al., 1998). Phylogeny strongly suggests that GlnRS originated in the eukaryota, and was later only acquired by certain bacteria, but never by archaea (Tumbula et al., 2000) through horizontal gene transfer (Lamour et al. 1994). Therefore, all eukaryotes express both GlnRS and GluRS, while all archaea and more than 90% of bacterial species studied thus far do not encode a GlnRS gene. When absent, GlnRS is replaced by a 2-step transamidation pathway involving a non-discriminating form of GluRS that attaches Glu to tRNA$^\text{Gln}$. A second enzymic step, performed by an tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (AdT), will amidate the misacylated Glu attached to tRNAGln into Gln prior to protein synthesis (Wilcox and Nirenberg, 1968, Sch√∂n et al., 1988, Curnow et al., 1997), as it does with [AsxRS](/class2/asp2/) (Becker et al., 1998):



$  \text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Gln}  + \text{ATP} + \text{Gln} \xrightarrow{\text{GatCAB or GatDE AdT}} \text{Gln-tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{ADP} + \text{P}_i + \text{Glu}  $



These non-discriminating variants are found in all organisms that lack GlnRS, such as all archaea, which express GlxRS-A, as well as the majority of bacteria which have a non-discriminating variant [GlxRS-B](/class1/glu1/) (Lapointe et al., 1986), or more rarely the noncognate variant GluGlnRS which only attaches Glu to tRNA$^\text{Gln}$  and not to tRNA$^\text{Glu}$ (Skouloubris et al. 2003, Salazar et al. 2003). 
This page details the non-discriminating Archeal-like GlxRS-A. The enzyme is an primordial remnant, offering a glimpse into life before the last universal common ancestor. 



## Structure



The N-terminal catalytic domain of GlxRS-A closely resembles the other members of subclass Ib: [GluRS-E](/class1/gln/), [GlnRS](/class1/glu1/), [GluRS-E](/class1/glu3/),  and GlxRS-B.
Their catalytic domains are characterized by an insertion within CP1, containing a loop flanked by two helices (SC1b IM), which 
may play a role in acceptor stem recognition  (Rath et al. 1998, Nureki et al. 2010).
GlxRS-A has a $\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain located at the C-terminal end (Rould et al. 1991), which is homologous to GluRS-E and GlnRS.
However it is distinct to the bacterial form GluRS-B, which instead has an $\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain of bacterial origin. 
The members of subclass Ib, alongside [ArgRS](/class1/arg/) and  [LysRS-I](/class1/lys/), require the presence of tRNA to catalyze activation of the amino acid substrate (Mitra and Mehler 1966, Ibba et al., 1999).
