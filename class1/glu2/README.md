The non-discriminating Archaeal-like glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GlxRS-A) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid glutamate to its cognate \tRNA$^\text{Glu}$, as well as to noncognate \tRNA$^\text{Gln}$. These reactions proceed through the following mechanisms:




$ \text{Glu} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Glu} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlxRS-A}} \text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Glu} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $


$ \text{Glu} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlxRS-A}} \text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $


A further enzyme (see below) is required to convert text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Gln} to text{Gln-tRNA}^\text{Gln} for correct incorporation of glutamine into proteins.


As discovered by Lamour and Mirande in 1994 and discussed more recently by Hadd and Perona 2014, the glutamyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases comprising subclass Ib (Lamour et al., 1994, Perona and Hadd 2012, Gomez et al., 2020), have a complex complex coevolutionary history. Their diversification occurred after the last universal common ancestor, with bacterial-like forms being characterized by an $\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain, and the archaeal and eukaryotic forms possessing a $\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain (Satiecka et al., 1998). Phylogeny strongly suggests that GlnRS originated in the eukaryota, and was only later acquired by certain bacteria, but never by archaea (Tumbula et al., 2000) through horizontal gene transfer (Lamour et al. 1994). Therefore, all eukaryotes express forms of both GlnRS and GluRS, while all archaea and more than 90% of bacterial species studied thus far do not possess a GlnRS-encoding gene.

When GlxRS or GluGlnRS attaches Glu to the noncognate \text{tRNA}^\text{Gln}$, a tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (AdT), replaces the Glu with a Gln residue, producing the \text{Gln-tRNA}^\text{Gln}$ required for correct incorporation of glutaminyl residues into proteins (Nirenberg and Wilcox, 1968, Sch√∂n et al., 1988, Curnow et al., 1997).  The same enzyme corrects the attachment of Asp residues to \text{tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ by the nondiscriminating AsxRS (Becker et al., 1998, Raczniak et al. 2001). 

The transamidation reaction is:

$  \text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Gln}  + \text{ATP} + \text{Gln} \xrightarrow{\text{GatCAB or GatDE AdT}} \text{Gln-tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{ADP} + \text{P}_i + \text{Glu}  $

This non-discriminating GlxRS enzyme is found in all organisms that lack GlnRS, including the majority of bacteria, which have a non-discriminating variant GlxRS-B (Lapointe et al., 1986), or more rarely the discriminating-noncognate variant GluGlnRS which only attaches Glu to tRNA$^\text{Gln}$ and not to its cognate tRNA$^\text{Glu}$ (Skouloubris et al. 2003, Salazar et al. 2003).


The non-discriminating Archeal-like GlxRS-A enzyme is an primordial remnant, offering a glimpse into life before the last universal common ancestor. 



## Structure



The N-terminal catalytic domain of GlxRS-A closely resembles the other members of subclass Ib: [GluRS-E](/class1/gln/), [GlnRS](/class1/glu1/), [GluRS-E](/class1/glu3/),  and GlxRS-B.
The catalytic domains of these enzymes are characterized by an insertion within CP1, containing a loop flanked by two helices (SC1b IM), which 
may play a role in acceptor stem recognition  (Rath et al. 1998, Nureki et al. 2010).
GlxRS-A has a $\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain located at the C-terminal end (Rould et al. 1991), homologous to that of GluRS-E and GlnRS.
However it is distinct from the bacterial form GluRS-B, which instead has an $\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain of bacterial origin. 
The members of subclass Ib, alongside [ArgRS](/class1/arg/) and  [LysRS-I](/class1/lys/), require the presence of tRNA to catalyze activation of the amino acid substrate (Mitra and Mehler 1966, Ibba et al., 1999).
