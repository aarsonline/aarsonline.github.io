This page describes three glutamyl-tRNA synthetase families predominant in bacteria.
The three families attach the same amino acid (glutamate) to varying tRNA isoforms.
First, the discriminating bacterial-like glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS-B) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid glutamate to its cognate tRNA:


$ \text{Glu} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Glu} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GluRS-B}} \text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Glu} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



Second, the non-discriminating bacterial-like glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GlxRS-B) catalyzes the following two reactions:


$ \text{Glu} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Glu} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlxRS-B}} \text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Glu} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $ 


$ \text{Glu} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlxRS-B}} \text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



Third, the discriminating bacterial-like glutamyl-glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRSGlnRS) attached Glu to the tRNA of Gln:


$ \text{Glu} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GluGlnRS}} \text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $ 




As discovered by Lamour and Mirande in 1994 and discussed more recently by Hadd and Perona 2014, there is a complex coevolutionary history between glutamyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases, which comprise subclass Ib (Lamour et al., 1994, Perona and Hadd. 2012, Gomez et al., 2020). 
Their diversification occurred after the last universal common ancestor, with bacterial-like forms being characterized by an [$\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_EK), and the archaeal and eukaryotic forms possessing a [$\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class1/Anticodon_binding_domain_EQ) (Satiecka et al., 1998).
Phylogeny strongly suggests that GlnRS originated in the eukaryota, and was later only acquired by certain bacteria, but never by archaea (Tumbula et al., 2000) through horizontal gene transfer (Lamour et al. 1994). Therefore, all eukaryotes express both GlnRS and GluRS, while all archaea and more than 90% of bacterial species studied thus far do not encode a GlnRS gene. 



When GlnRS is absent, its role is replaced by a 2-step transamidation pathway involving a non-discriminating form of GluRS that attaches Glu to tRNAGln. A second enzymic step, performed by an tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (AdT), will amidate the misacylated Glu attached to tRNAGln into Gln prior to protein synthesis (Nirenberg and Wilcox, 1968, Sch√∂n et al., 1988, Curnow et al., 1997), as it does with [AsxRS](/class2/asp2/)  (Becker et al., 1998, Raczniak et al. 2001).
The second step of this reaction is:


$  \text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Gln}  + \text{ATP} + \text{Gln} \xrightarrow{\text{GatCAB or GatDE AdT}} \text{Gln-tRNA}^\text{Gln} + \text{ADP} + \text{P}_i + \text{Glu}  $


This non-discriminating enzyme is found in all organisms that lack GlnRS, such as all archaea, which express [GlxRS-A](/class1/glu2/), as well as the majority of bacteria, which have a non-discriminating variant [GlxRS-B](/class1/glu1/) (Lapointe et al., 1986),  or more rarely the noncognate variant GluGlnRS which only attaches Glu to tRNA$^\text{Gln}$ and not to tRNA$^\text{Glu}$ (Skouloubris et al. 2003, Salazar et al. 2003).








## Structure


GluRS-B (Nureki et al., 1995), GlxRS-B (Schulze et al., 2006), and GluGlnRS are the bacterial counterparts to the eurarchaeal  [GluRS-E](/class1/glu3) and GlxRS-A, respectively, differentiated by their distinct catalytic domain sequences and anticodon binding domain structures.
The three families are challenging to distinguish using sequence-based comparisons (Schulze et al. 2006), and hence their putative functional assignments
are unified in a single alignment below.



The N-terminal catalytic domains of GluRS-B, GlxRS-B, and GluGlnRS closely resembles the other members of subclass Ib: <a href="/class1/gln">GlnRS</a>, GlxRS-A, and GluRS-E.
Their catalytic domains are characterized by an insertion within CP1, containing a loop flanked by two helices (SC1b IM), which 
may play a role in acceptor stem recognition  (Rath et al. 1998, Nureki et al. 2010).
The $\alpha$-helical anticodon binding domain of GluRS-B and GlxRS-B are located at their C-terminal ends and are homologous with that of [LysRS-I](/class1/lys/) (Terada et al. 2002), in contrast to the other members of Ib, which instead have a $\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain of archaeal origin. 
The members of subclass Ib, alongside [ArgRS](/class1/arg/) and LysRS-I, require the presence of tRNA to catalyze activation of the amino acid substrate (Mitra and Mehler 1966, Ibba et al. 1999).

## Clinical significance



In the human mitochondria, Gln-tRNA$^\text{Gln}$ is produced through through the transmidation pathway whereby, like in bacteria, a non-discriminating GlxRS generates a mitochondrial Glu-tRNA$^\text{Gln}$ prior to its conversion by a mitochondrial GatCAB AdT into mitochondrial Gln-tRNA$^\text{Gln}$ (Nagao et al. 2009, Echevarria et al. 2014).
Biallelic recessive variants (homozygous and compound heterozygous) in the human gene EARS2, encoding the mitochondrial gluRS cause the brain disease LTBL for Leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate (firstly described in Steenweg et al. 2012). The exhaustive list of disease-causing variants of EARS2 (including location on the sequence and the structure, the conservation of the affected residues, and the related references) can be found [here](http://misynpat.org/misynpat/PageMaker.rvt?name=EARS2). Mutations have been mapped to all domains of the mt-GluRS.
