The anticodon binding domain F recognises the tRNA anticodon loop (Klipcan et al. 2010, Pouplana and Schimmel, 2001). This compact domain consists of a three-stranded $\beta$ sheet and two $\alpha$-helices. It resides at the C-termini of two PheRS families: the $\beta$ subunit of the bacterial-like [PheRS-B](/class2/phe2/), and the monomeric mitochondrial-like [PheRS-M](/class2/phe5/). The domain does not appear in the eukaryotic/archaeal cytosolic form [PheRS-A](/class2/phe4/).  The evolutionary conservation of the domain is supported by the restoration of aminoacylation of human tRNAPhe mutants through compensatory amino acid replacements in human mitochodrial anticodon binding domain F (Ling et al., 2007).
