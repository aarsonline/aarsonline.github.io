The C-terminal junction domain IV is an $\alpha/\beta$ domain at the C-termini of [ValRS](/class1/val/) and [IleRS](/class1/ile) that recognises the anticodon stem (Fukai et al. 2000). 
There is an elongated insertion between two $\beta$ strands. Most members are lacking the insertion, but it is present in one type of IleRS (IleRS-2) as well as an Archaeal ValRS (*Methanobacterium paludis*).
