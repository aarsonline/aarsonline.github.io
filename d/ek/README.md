The anticodon binding domain EK is a $\alpha$-helical structure. It resides at the C-termini of [LysRS-I](/class1/lys), [GluRS-B](/class1/glu1) and GlxRS-B. The domain is distinct from the $\beta$-barrel anticodon binding domain of the closely-related archael-like enzymes [GlnRS](/class1/gln/), [GluRS-E](/class1/glu3), and [GlxRS-A](/class1/glu2).
