The anticodon binding domain EQ is a $\beta$-barrel structure. It resides at the C-termini of [GlnRS](/class1/gln/), [GluRS-E](/class1/glu3), and [GlxRS-A](/class1/glu2). The domain is distinct from the helical anticodon binding domain of the closely-related bacterial-like enzymes [GluRS-B](/class1/glu1) and GlxRS-B.
