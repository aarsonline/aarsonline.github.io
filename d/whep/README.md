The WHEP domain is a two helix bundle that occurs in several eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases including *W* ([TrpRS](/class1/trp)), *H* ([HisRS](/class2/his)), and *EP* RS ([GluRS-E](/class1/glu3) and [ProRS-A](/class2/pro1)), as well as [MetRS](/class1/met) and [GlyRS-E](/class2/gly3) (Guo and Yang 2014).

The WHEP domain was first acquired as an N-terminal extension by HisRS and GlyRS at an early stage of eukaryotic evolution (Shiba 2002). The acquisition of the WHEP domain to GluProRS happened concurrently with the fusion of GluRS and ProRS into one gene, an event that took place prior to the divergence of cnidarians and bilaterians (Ray et al. 2011). In contrast to other aaRSs that have only one WHEP domain, GluProRS contains a varying number of WHEP domains depending on the species. Human GluProRS contains three consecutive WHEP domains in between the N-terminal GluRS and the C-terminal ProRS. TrpRS and MetRS appear to have the latest WHEP domain acquisition events (at N- and C-termini, respectively) that did not occur until the first vertebrates (Shiba 2002). 

The two helices in the WHEP domain are amphiphilic and contain several conserved leucine residues and positively charged lysines and arginines (Qin et al. 2016). The conserved leucines zip the two helices together by hydrophobic interactions and the positively charged residues may interact with nucleic acids such as tRNA. 

Generally, the WHEP domain is not required for catalytic activity. The WHEP domain alone from *Caenorhabditis elegans* GlyRS lacks tRNA binding activity, but its deletion reduced the catalytic efficiency, while increasing the stability of the enzyme (Chang et al. 2016). Crystal structure of human GlyRS/tRNA complex revealed that the WHEP domain is located near the single-stranded 3′-end of tRNA, without direct contact (Qin et al. 2016). 

## Non-canonical functions

WHEP domains are involved in non-canonical functions through protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. The WHEP domains of GluProRS mediate interactions with NSAPI, RPL13a, and GAPDH to form a gamma-IFN-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex for translation silencing. The WHEP domains are also responsible for recognizing target mRNAs at the 5'-UTR (Jie et al. 2008). The WHEP domain of TrpRS mediates interactions with DNA-PK and PARP-1 in the nucleus to activate p53 (Sajish M et al. 2012). WHEP domain-dependent interaction of extracellular TrpRS with TLR2/4 activates innate immunity against viral and bacterial infection (Ahn et al. 2016). Extracellular vesicle-associated GlyRS, through its WHEP domain, interacts with CELSR2 to activate M1 polarization and phagocytosis and suppresses tumor initiation (Park et al. 2022).The WHEP domain is required for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-associated mutant GlyRS binding to G3BP in stress granules (Cui et al. 2022).

The WHEP domain is also a regulator for non-canonical functions of human TrpRS. The WHEP domain can be removed by proteolysis or alternative splicing to generate T2-TrpRS or mini-TrpRS, respectively, both exhibit angiostatic activity through interaction with the extracellular domain of VE-cadherin on the surface of endothelial cells (Wakasugi et al. 2002; Tzima et al. 2006). Mini-TrpRS but not T2-TrpRS also interacts with Nrp1 to inhibit endocytosis-dependent VE-cadherin turnover and vascular permeability (Gioelli et al. 2022). 
A splice variant of HisRS encoding the WHEP domain plus some extra sequences at the C-terminus (aa 1–60) was identified in human skeletal muscle and found to be highly enriched in human lung compared with other tissues (Zhou et al. 2014). 

## Clinical significance

A fusion protein composed of human IgG1 Fc and the HisRS WHEP domain (aa 1–60), named ATYR1923 or efzofitimod, was shown to reduce inflammation and fibrosis in animal models of ILD. Efzofitimod was also evaluated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 1b/2a study in anti–Jo-1-negative patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, a major form of ILD. Dose-dependent benefits of efzofitimod were indicated on several endpoints, including steroid reduction, lung function, clinical symptoms, and inflammatory biomarkers (Culver et al. 2023).
