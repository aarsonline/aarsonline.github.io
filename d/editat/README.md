The post-transfer editing domain AT (Edit-AT) catalyzes the removal of misacylated serine and glycine residues from the cognate acceptor stems of alanine and threonine:


$ \text{Ser-tRNA}^\text{Ala} \xrightarrow{\text{Edit-AT}} \text{Ser} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Ala} $

$ \text{Gly-tRNA}^\text{Ala} \xrightarrow{\text{Edit-AT}} \text{Gly} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Ala} $

$ \text{Ser-tRNA}^\text{Thr} \xrightarrow{\text{Edit-AT}} \text{Ser} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Thr} $


Paralogs of Edit-AT exist at the N-terminal of [ThrRS](/class2/thr/), the C-terminal of [AlaRS](/class2/ala/), and in the form of the trans-acting factor AlaX, which also targets Ser-tRNA$^\text{Ala}$ (Ahel et al., 2003; Beebe et al., 2008; Dock-Bregeon et al., 2004). This editing activity lowers the rate of threonine-to-serine, alanine-to-glycine, and alanine-to-serine mistranslations. (A $\rightarrow$ S) mistranslation is known to cause severe damage, such as neurodegeneration in mammals (Lee et al., 2006) heat sensitivity in E. coli (Kelly et al., 2019) and yeast (Zhang et al., 2021). Many systems have evolved trans-editing AlaX proteins to further lower the (A $\rightarrow$ S) mistranslation rate (Guo et al., 2009; Kuzmishin Nagy et al., 2020). 

Edit-AT domains contain conserved HXXXH and CXXXH zinc-binding motifs, which are critical for the editing activity (Ahel et al., 2003; Beebe et al., 2008; Dock-Bregeon et al., 2004). Mutation of this Cys residue causes embryonic lethality in mice (Liu et al., 2014). Several forms of AlaX proteins are present in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, and it is suggested that AlaX-S is likely the predecessor of Edit-AT (Kuzmishin Nagy et al., 2020).
