The anticodon binding domain CRIMVL is an $\alpha$-helical protein. It resides at the C-termini of several Class I AARS: [CysRS](/class1/cys/), [ArgRS](/class1/arg/),  [IleRS](/class1/ile/),  [MetRS](/class1/met/), [ValRS](/class1/val/), [LeuRS-A](/class1/leu2/), and [LeuRS-B](/class1/leu1/), where it recognises the tRNA anticodon loop, approaching the acceptor stem from the minor groove side (de Pouplana and Schimmel, 2001). 




<!--
	ArgRS: downstream; also D-loop
	CysRS: downstream; but it does not recognise anticodon? There is a 2nd domain which does that
