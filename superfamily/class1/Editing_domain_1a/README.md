The common post-transfer editing domain found in the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases families [IleRS](/class1/ile), [ValRS](/class1/val), [LeuRS-A](/class1/leu2) and [LeuRS-B](/class1/leu1) catalyzes the hydrolytic removal of misacylated amino acids from the 3'-terminal A76 ribose of misacylated tRNAs. For example:


$ \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{Nva-tRNA}^\text{Leu} \xrightarrow{} \text{Nva} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Leu} $

$ \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{Thr-tRNA}^\text{Val} \xrightarrow{} \text{Thr} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Val} $

$ \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{Val-tRNA}^\text{Ile} \xrightarrow{} \text{Val} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Ile} $



In each case, the post-transfer editing reaction occurs after the misacylated single stranded 3'-end of the tRNA is translocated across the enzyme surface from the synthetic active site in the Rossmann fold domain, to the editing domain active site (Nureki et al., 1998; Silvian et al., 1999; Palencia et al., 2012; reviewed in Perona & Hadd, 2012).

In all cases, the editing and synthetic domains adopt a very similar relative orientation, enabling the common translocation mechanism. Interestingly, however, the insertion point of the editing domain into the Rossmann fold is variable: the domain resides upstream of the CP2 insertion for ValRS, IleRS, and LeuRS-A, but downstream of CP2 in the case of the bacterial-like form LeuRS-B (Fukunaga et al. 2005).
