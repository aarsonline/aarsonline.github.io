The post-transfer editing domain LIV (Edit-LIV) catalyzes the removal of misacylated residues $X$ from the cognate acceptor stems of isoleucine, leucine, and valine:


$ X\text{-tRNA}^\text{Ile} \xrightarrow{\text{Edit-LIV}} X + \text{tRNA}^\text{Ile} $

$ X\text{-tRNA}^\text{Leu} \xrightarrow{\text{Edit-LIV}} X + \text{tRNA}^\text{Leu} $

$ X\text{-tRNA}^\text{Val} \xrightarrow{\text{Edit-LIV}} X + \text{tRNA}^\text{Val} $


The domain appears within the catalytic domains of [IleRS](/class1/ile), [ValRS](/class1/val), and the two forms of LeuRS: [LeuRS-A](/class1/leu2) and [LeuRS-B](/class1/leu1).
This provides further amino acid selectivity by expelling a wide range of mistargetted amino acids such alanine, cysteine, threonine, valine, isoleucine, methionine, homocysteine, and norvaline (Gomez and Ibba, 2020). 
 ValRS also targets misactivated amino acids, such as threonine, through pre-transfer editing activity (Fersht et al. 1976). 
 Its discrimination first against size (i.e. by filtering out isoleucine), and second against polarity (i.e. removal of misactivated threonine) has been described as a double-sieve mechanism (Fersht et al. 1976, Fukai et al. 2000). 


Interestingly, the domain resides in two different parts of the catalytic domain's primary sequence: upstream of the CP2 insertion for ValRS, IleRS, and LeuRS-A, and downstream of CP2 in the case of the bacterial-like form LeuRS-B  (Fukunaga et al. 2005).
