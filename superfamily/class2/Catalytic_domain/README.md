The catalytic domain of the Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS-II) activates amino acids so that their cognate tRNA can be charged. 
In total, thirteen of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids are incorporated into the protein, through at least 22 distinct AARS-II families; a single representative from each of which is displayed below.
These amino acids are alanine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glycine, histidine, lysine, phenylalanine, proline, pyrrolysine, selenocysteine, serine, and threonine. 
Lysine and cysteine are also incorporated during translation via the Class I aminoacyl tRNA synthetases [LysRS-I](/class1/lys) and [CysRS](/class1/cys). 




While still part part of the Class II catalytic domain superfamily, the $\beta$ subunits of the [PheRS](/class2/phe1) families do not in fact catalyze amino acid activation (Klipcan et al. 2020), 
but they are still displayed below.
