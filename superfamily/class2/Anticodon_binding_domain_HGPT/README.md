The anticodon binding domain HGPT recognises the tRNA anticodon loop, approaching the acceptor stem from the major groove side (Cusack et al. 1998,  Sankaranarayanan et al. 1999, Tian et al. 2015). This compact domain consists of a five-stranded $\beta$ sheet and resides at the C-termini of four Class II AARS: [HisRS](/class2/his/), [ProRS](/class2/pro1/),  [ThrRS](/class2/thr/),  and  the dimeric  [GlyRS](/class2/gly1/).


This domain was mostly likely transferred between subclasses IIa (ProRS, ThrRS, and GlyRS) and IIc (HisRS), which have quite distinct catalytic domains (Douglas et al. 2023). The remaining members of subclass IIa - [SerRS](/class2/ser1/) and [SerRS-A](/class2/ser2/) - are lacking this domain.
