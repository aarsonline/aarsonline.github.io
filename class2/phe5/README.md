The mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS-M) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid phenylalanine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Phe} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{PheRS-M}} \text{Phe-tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $


The gene for PheRS-M is expressed in the nucleus and the protein is localized to the mitochondria and chloroplasts (Duchêne et al., 2005). 
The phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS) are considered to be one of the most evolutionarily complex enzymes among aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Klipcan et al., 2010). 
There are three variants of PheRS, with PheRS-M being the only monomeric Class II synthetase. 
The other two variants of PheRS are heterotetrameric, with [PheRS-B](/class2/phe1) found primarily in bacteria and [PheRS-A](/class2/phe3) found in eukaryotes/archaea (Finarov et al., 2010).


The catalytic core of PheRS-M is similar to that of the other PheRS families, as well as [HisRS](/class2/his) and [SepRS](/class2/sep). 
Together, these enzymes comprise subclass IIc (Douglas et al., 2023, Kavran et al. 2007, Perona et al. 2012, Valencia-Sánchez et al. 2016). 
The core of PheRS-M is most similar to the [&alpha; chain](/class2/phe1) of the bacterial PheRS.
In contrast, the C-terminal [anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class2/Anticodon_binding_domain_F) appears to have been borrowed from the bacterial [&beta; subunit](/class2/phe2)  (domain B8; Klipcan et al. 2010). This suggests that the mitochondrial PheRS may be a chimera between the two bacterial PheRS subunits. 


Unlike the cytosolic variants, there is no known editing activity for the mitochondrial PheRS (Roy et al. 2005, Klipcan et al. 2010). Consequently, the non-canonical amino acid meta-tyrosine is especially toxic in mitochondria due to this lack of editing activity (Klipcan et al. 2009).  All types of PheRS are known to mischarge tyrosyl groups, which suggests that mitochondrial translation of phenylalanine may be less accurate than the cytosolic form.
