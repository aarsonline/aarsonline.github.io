Threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid threonine to its cognate tRNA:

  
  
  
  

$ \text{Thr} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Thr} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{ThrRS}} \text{Thr-tRNA}^\text{Thr} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i $

  
  
  
  

ThrRS belongs to subclass IIa, which includes other enzymes such as [ProRS](/class2/pro1), [SerRS](/class2/ser1), and the dimeric [GlyRS](/class2/gly1) (Gomez et al. 2020, Valencia-SÃ¡nchez et al. 2016, Perona et al. 2012). The [anticodon binding domains](/superfamily/class2/Anticodon_binding_domain_HGPT) of subclass IIa, with the exception of SerRS, are homologous with that of [HisRS](/class2/his), and are located at the C-terminal end (Wolf et al. 1999). 



## Structure


The catalytic domain of ThrRS is typical of a Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). The catalytic domain is characterized by the ~40 residue ThrRS insertion module which resides between motifs 2 and 3, which is stabilized by a short $\beta$ strand that runs parallel with the six stranded antiparallel fold of the catalytic domain (Douglas et al. 2023). This module, also known as the threonine loop, undergoes large conformational changes upon threonine binding (Torres-Larios et al. 2003).

  

## Editing


ThrRS also has an editing function, which occurs at the post-transfer level to remove mischarged serines from tRNA$^\text{Thr}$ (Dock-Bregeon et al. 2000). This is achieved through the two N-terminal domains N1 and N2 (Dock-Bregeon et al. 2004). The [editing domain](/superfamily/class2/Editing_domain_AT/) (N2) is homologous with that of [AlaRS](/class2/ala), which is conversely located downstream of the catalytic domain (Sankaranarayanan et al. 1999). In some archaea, a non-homologous N-terminal editing domain, which also targets mischarged serine, is present instead of the N1 and N2 domains in ThrRS (Hussain et al. 2006)



## Non-translational functions

The human mitochondrial ThrRS (TARS2) is required for threonine-sensitive activation of mTORC1, the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin Complex1 (Kim et al. 2021). The authors showed that in the presence of threonine, a fraction of TARS2 is found in the cytosol and contributes to the functional switch of the lysosomal Rag/Ragulator complex then able to bind mTORC1.

## Clinical significance

The human gene TARS1 encoding the cytosolic ThrRS has been linked to autosomal recessive nonphotosensitive trichothiodystrophy-7 (TTD7), which is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous variants (Theil et al. 2019). It is characterized by brittle hair and ichthyosis, a skin disease.

Biallelic recessive variants (homozygous and heterozygous compound) in the human gene TARS2 encoding the mitochondrial ThrRS cause a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (firstly described in Diodato et al. 2014). The exhaustive list of disease-causing variants of TARS2 (including location on the sequence and the structure, the conservation of affected residues, and the related references) can be found [here](http://misynpat.org/misynpat/PageMaker.rvt?name=TARS2). Mutations have been mapped to all domains of the mt-ThrRS except the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS).
