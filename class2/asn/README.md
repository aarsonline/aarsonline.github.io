Asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (AsnRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid asparagine to its cognate tRNA:



$ \text{Asn} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{AsnRS}} \text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i $



## Organisms that lack AsnRS
Although AsnRS is classically involved in direct $\text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ synthesis in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotes, about half of bacteria and archaea lack this enzyme, making direct $\text{tRNA}^\text{Asn}$  charging with L-asparagine impossible (Kern et al, 2005). Instead, they possess "non-discriminating AspRSs" (ND-AspRS or [AsxRS](/class2/asp2/)) that charge L-aspartate to both $\text{tRNA}^\text{Asp}$ and $\text{tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ yielding either an $\text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asp}$ or a misacylated $\text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ (Becker & Kern, 1998; Becker et al., 2000; Curnow et al., 1996).

$ \text{Asp} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Asp} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{AsxRS}} \text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asp} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i $



$ \text{Asp} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{AsxRS}} \text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i $

While $\text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asp}$ is directly used in protein synthesis, misacylated $\text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ is then used by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (AdT), that eventually amidates it to $\text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ (Becker & Kern, 1998; Curnow et al, 1998; Curnow et al, 1996) in an ATP-dependent manner. The AdT activates L-aspartate’s side chain through phosphorylation, followed by amidation using an amido group donor.

$ \text{ATP} + \text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{NH3} \xrightarrow{\text{AdT}} \text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{ADP} + \text{P}_i $

The same mechanism is employed by the Class I GlxRS families, when a GlnRS is absent, leading to the hypothesis that AsnRS and GlnRS were among the last of the synthetases to evolve (de Pouplana & Schimmel, 2001). AsnRSs likely evolved in eukaryotes from an [AspRS-E](/class2/asp2/), from where they became horizontally transferred to some bacteria and archaea (Roy et al., 2003).


## Structure

The three-dimensional structure of AsnRS closely resembles that of AsxRS, AspRS-E, [AspRS-B](/class2/asp1/), and [LysRS-II](/class2/lys/), with an N-terminal [anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class2/Anticodon_binding_domain_DNK/) and a C-terminal catalytic domain.
The four members have quite similar catalytic domains and constitute subclass IIb (Cusack et al., 1991; Valencia-Sánchez et al., 2016).
The subclass IIb synthetases of many eukaryotes contain a flexible domain at their N-termini, which helps to anchor the synthetase onto the tRNA (Frugier et al., 2000).

  

The C-terminal catalytic domain of AsnRS is quite typical of a Class II AARS.
Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al., 2018).
In the active site, asparagine recognition is largely achieved through water molecule interactions, in contrast with AspRS where aspartate recognition is facilitated by direct interaction with the protein (Iwasaki et al., 2006).
This specificity is also achieved by the replacement of positively charged residues with negatively
charged ones in the active site (Kern et al., 2005).
The catalytic domain of AsnRS, much like the other members of subclass IIb, is characterized by the subclass IIb insertion modules 1 and 2 (Douglas et al. 2023).

## Clinical significance

The human gene NARS1 encoding the cytosolic AsnRS has been linked to two similar neurodevelopmental diseases. The first named NEDMILG for neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, impaired language, and gait abnormalities is caused by biallelic variants (homozygous or heterozygous), whereas in the second entity named NEDMILEG for neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, impaired language, epilepsy, and gait abnormalities the causative variant is a de novo heterozygous mutation (Manole et al. 2020). 

Biallelic recessive variants (homozygous and compound heterozygous) in the human gene NARS2 encoding the mitochondrial AsnRS cause brain disease and phenotypes including Alpers syndrome (Sofou et al. 2015) and non-syndromic deafness and Leigh syndrome (Simon et al. 2015). The exhaustive list of disease-causing variants of NARS2 (including location on sequence and structure, the conservation of affected residues, and the related references) can be found [here](http://misynpat.org/misynpat/PageMaker.rvt?name=NARS2). Mutations have been mapped to all domains of the mt-AsnRS except the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence.
