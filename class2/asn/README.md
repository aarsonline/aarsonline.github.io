Asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (AsnRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid asparagine to its cognate tRNA:



$ \text{Asn} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{AsnRS}} \text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i $



Some organisms do not possess AsnRS, in which case the incorporation of asparagine into the polypeptide can be accomplished through the use
of a non-discriminating [AsxRS](/class2/asp2/), coupled with amidotransferase activity (Becker et al. 1997, Raczniak et al. 2001).
The same mechanism is employed by the Class I [GlxRS](/class1/glu2/) and [GlnRS](/class1/gln/) families,
leading to the hypothesis that AsnRS and GlnRS were among the last of the synthetases to evolve (de Pouplana and Schimmel, 2001).

  

The three-dimensional structure of AsnRS closely resembles that of AsxRS, [AspRS](/class2/asp1/), and [LysRS-II](/class2/lys/), with an N-terminal [anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class2/Anticodon_binding_domain_DNK/) and a C-terminal catalytic domain.
The four members have quite similar catalytic domains and constitute subclass IIb (Cusack et al., 1991; Valencia-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2016).
The subclass IIb synthetases of many eukaryotes contain a flexible domain at their N-termini, which helps to anchor the synthetase onto the tRNA (Frugier et al., 2000).
Editing activity has not been detected for AsnRS (Gomez and Ibba, 2020).

  

The C-terminal catalytic domain of AsnRS is quite typical of a Class II AARS.
Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al., 2018).
In the active site, asparagine recognition is largely achieved through water molecule interactions, in contrast with AspRS where aspartate recognition is facilitated by direct interaction with the protein (Iwasaki et al., 2006).
This specificity is also achieved by the replacement of positively charged residues with negatively
charged ones in the active site (Kern et al., 2005).
The catalytic domain of AsnRS, much like the other members of subclass IIb, is characterized by the subclass IIb insertion modules 1 and 2 (Douglas et al. 2023).
