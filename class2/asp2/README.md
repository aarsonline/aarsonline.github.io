This page describes two aspartyl-tRNA synthetase families.
The discriminating eukaryotic aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS-E) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid aspartate to its cognate tRNA:


$ \text{Asp} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Asp} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{AspRS-E}} \text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asp} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



Whereas, the non-discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AsxRS) catalyzes the following two reactions:


$ \text{Asp} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Asp} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{AsxRS}} \text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $ 


$ \text{Asp} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{AsxRS}} \text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $





This last reaction enables the incorporation of aspartate into the polypeptide, while the second enables incorporation of asparagine for organisms that lack [AsnRS](/class2/asn).
An amidotransferase subsequently corrects $\text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ into $\text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ (Becker et al. 1997, Raczniak et al. 2001).
There is also a discriminating [AspRS](/class2/asp1) which can carry out this first reaction but not the second one. 
AspRS exists in two forms which likely converged independently - the standard form  AspRS found in bacteria, organelles, and archaea, 
and the eukaryote-like form AspRS-E, which displays high levels of sequence and structural similarity with AsxRS (Kern et al. 2013), and hence is detailed on this webpage. 



  
  
## Structure

The three-dimensional structure of AsxRS closely resembles that of AsnRS, AspRS, and [LysRS-II](/class2/lys/), with an N-terminal [anticodon binding domain](/superfamily/class2/Anticodon_binding_domain_DNK/) and a C-terminal catalytic domain.
The four members have quite similar catalytic domains and constitute subclass IIb (Cusack et al., 1991; Valencia-Sánchez et al., 2016).
The subclass IIb synthetases of many eukaryotes contain a flexible domain at their N-termini, which helps to anchor the synthetase onto the tRNA (Frugier et al., 2000).
Many fungal AsxRS contain a C-terminal domain (formerly known as DUF2156, Datt et al. 2014) which transfers aspartate from $\text{tRNA}^\text{Asp}$ onto ergosterol (Yakobov et al. 2020).

 
 

The C-terminal catalytic domain of AsxRS is quite typical of a Class II AARS.
Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al., 2018).
Like the other members of subclass IIb, its catalytic domain is characterized by the subclass IIb insertion modules 1 and 2 (Douglas et al. 2023).

## Clinical significance

Recessive mutations in the human gene DARS1 encoding the cytosolic AspRS cause a phenotype of hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and spasticity (HBSL)
 (Taft et al. 2013). Similar brain disease LBSL for leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation is caused
 by recessive mutations in the DARS2 gene encoding the human mitochondrial AspRS (Scheper et al. 2007). DARS2 was the first identified mitochondrial AARS disease gene.
