The archaeal/eukaryotic aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (E-AspRS) is an enzyme found in archaea and eukaryotes that catalyzes the attachment of the amino acid L-aspartate to its cognate $\text{tRNA}^\text{Asp}$. 

$ \text{Asp} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Asp} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{AsxRS}} \text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $ 

In this case, the enzyme charges only its cognate $\text{tRNA}^\text{Asp}$ and is therefore referred to as “discriminating.” Discriminating AspRSs have been isolated and described early in eukaryotes (E-AspRS) (Barnett & Epler, 1966; Diller & Tener, 1971; Gangloff & Dirheimer, 1973; Berg, 1975) as well as in bacteria (B-AspRS) (Norton et al, 1963; Akesson & Lundvik, 1978; Eriani et al, 1990; Kern & Lapointe, 1979). They were found to be specific of L-aspartate and $\text{tRNA}^\text{Asp}$. Later, structure determinations showed that AspRSs distribute into two structural types: the bacterial-type (B-AspRS) enzymes, harboring a distinctive insertion domain in the catalytic domain, known as the GAD domain (Delarue et al, 1994), which is not present in archaeal/eukaryotic-type AspRSs (E-AspRS) (Ruff et al, 1991). 



## Non-discriminating AspRSs

Although it was first believed that each aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase would activate one single amino acid and transfer it onto one single tRNA isoacceptor family, AspRSs came to be discovered in the late 90s, termed “non-discriminating AspRSs” that charge L-aspartate to both tRNAAsp and tRNAAsn yielding either an Asp-tRNAAsp or a misacylated Asp-tRNAAsn (Becker & Kern, 1998; Becker et al, 1997; Curnow et al, 1996).

$ \text{Asp} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Asp} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{AspRS}} \text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asp} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i $



$ \text{Asp} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{AspRS}} \text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i $


Non-discriminating AspRSs are found in both the B-AspRSs and in E-AspRSs structural types. The first to be discovered were of the archaeal/eukaryotic-type AspRS (E-AspRS) (Becker & Kern, 1998; Becker et al, 1997; Curnow et al, 1996), whereas non-discriminating B-AspRSs (commonly found in bacteria) were studied later (Raczniak et al, 2001; Akochy et al, 2004; Chuawong et al, 2006).

## Non-discriminating AspRSs participate in a tRNA-dependent Asn biosynthesis pathway

In all organisms that harbor a non-discriminaing AspRS, misacylated $\text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ is an intermediate in an indirect $\text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ synthesis pathway (Sheppard et al, 2008; Hemmerle et al, 2020). It is used by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (AdT), that eventually amidates it to $\text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ (Becker & Kern, 1998; Curnow et al, 1998; Curnow et al, 1996) in an ATP-dependent manner. The AdT activates L-aspartate’s side chain through phosphorylation, followed by amidation using an amido group donor.

$ \text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn} +\text{ATP} + \text{NH3} \xrightarrow{\text{AdT}} \text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn} + \text{ADP} + \text{P}_i $


The bacterial AdT is a heterotrimeric enzyme named GatCAB, in which the B subunit binds $\text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ and catalyzes phosphorylation of the beta-carboxyl group of Asp’s side chain; the A subunit is an amidase that hydrolyzes L-glutamine or L-asparagine to generate NH3 (or can use free NH3) (Curnow et al, 1997). NH3 is then transferred through a molecular funnel from GatA towards GatB’s active site where amidation of $\text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ to $\text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ occurs (Nakamura et al, 2006). GatC is a molecular chaperone that participates in the heterotrimer assembly. In archaea, the non-discriminating AspRS is of the eukaryotic/archaeal type (E-AspRS), and functions together with an AdT homologous to that found in bacteria (Curnow et al, 1996; Namgoong et al, 2007; Sheppard et al, 2008a).
Usually in bacteria, a non-discriminating B-AspRS and one AdT are present that ensure the indirect synthesis of $\text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$. In several bacteria such as Thermus thermophilus (Becker & Kern, 1998) or Deinococcus radiodurans (Curnow et al, 1998) the two types of AspRSs are present (B-AspRS and E-AspRS), with the B-AspRS (AspRS1) being discriminating and the E-AspRS (AspRS2) non-discriminating (Becker et al, 2000). In archaea, it is an E-AspRS.
This indirect pathway resembles the indirect $\text{Gln-tRNA}^\text{Gln}$ pathway that involves a non-discriminating GluRS, $\text{Glu-tRNA}^\text{Gln}$ formation, and an AdT, that is found in bacteria and archaea (Sheppard et al, 2008b and Hemmerle et al, 2020).

## Why is there a tRNA-dependent Asn biosynthesis pathway ?

This pathway is likely ancestral (Sheppard et al, 2008c; de Pouplana & Schimmel, 2001) and was used before AsnRS emerged from AspRSs in an ancestor of eukaryotes (Roy et al, 2003). Today, whereas AsnRS is classically involved in direct $\text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ synthesis in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotes, about half of bacteria and archaea still lack this enzyme, making direct tRNAAsn charging with L-asparagine impossible (Kern et al, 2005). This indirect pathway is also present when prokaryotes lack canonical asparagine biosynthesis enzymes (asparagine synthetases), regardless of the presence or not of an AsnRS (Becker & Kern, 1998; Min et al, 2002; Luque et al, 2008; Mladenova et al, 2014; Fischer et al, 2012). 

## Ribonucleoprotein complexes for the tRNA-dependent Asn biosynthesis pathway

In prokaryotes that use the indirect $\text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ biosynthesis pathway, the non-discriminating AspRS, $\text{tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ and GatCAB AdT assemble into a stable ribonucleoprotein complex, the asparagine transamidosome. Within this complex, $\text{tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ is first aspartylated by the non-disciminating AspRS (B-AspRS or E-AspRS), forming the misacylated $\text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ intermediate that remains trapped in the complex, before the acceptor arm of $\text{tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ shuttles towards the GatB active site, where it is amidated to $\text{Asn-tRNA}^\text{Asn}$ (Bailly et al, 2007; Blaise et al, 2010). The asparagine transamidosome was first described in the bacterium Thermus thermophilus, which possesses a non-discriminating eukaryotic/archaeal (E-AspRS) (Bailly et al, 2007). It features unique structural and kinetic properties (Blaise et al, 2010) that differ from asparagine transamidosomes that use non-discriminating B-AspRSs, such as in the human pathogens Helicobacter pylori (Fischer et al, 2012) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Suzuki et al, 2015).


  
  
## Structure

Two main structural types of AspRSs have been described: the eukaryotic/archaeal-type AspRSs, named E-AspRS (found in eukaryotes, archaea and some bacteria) and the bacterial-type AspRSs, B-AspRS (found in all bacteria, mitochondria and plastids). Both share strong structural homology. In both cases, the three-dimensional structure of AspRS closely resembles that of AsnRS, and LysRS-II, with an N-terminal anticodon binding domain of the OB-Fold family and a C-terminal catalytic domain (Ruff et al, 1991; Delarue et al, 1994; Onesti et al, 1995). Non-discriminating AspRSs are found in both the bacterial and eukaryotic structural types. As an example, the B-AspRS in E. coli is discriminating, whereas the B-AspRS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Akochy et al, 2004) or Helicobacter pylori (Chuawong et al, 2006) are of the non-discriminating functional type. The E-AspRS from the bacteria Thermus thermophilus and Deinococcus radiodurans are non-discriminating, whereas the E-AspRS found in Pyrococcus kodakaraensis is discriminating, like all cytoplasmic eukaryotic AspRSs (Charron et al, 2003). Differences in the anticodon-binding domain are involved in relaxed or narrowed specificities in the two functional types (discriminating or ND) of AspRSs (Charron et al, 2003; Feng et al, 2005; Bernard et al, 2006; Chuawong et al, 2006).

The four members of class IIb AARS (bacterial-, AsxRS-types, AsnRS and LysRS II) have quite similar catalytic domains and constitute subclass IIb (Cusack et al., 1991; Valencia-Sánchez et al., 2016). The subclass IIb AARS of many eukaryotes contain a flexible domain at their N-termini, which helps to anchor the synthetase onto the tRNA, both in the yeast S. cerevisiae (Frugier et al., 2000; Ryckelynck et al, 2003) and in the human (Escalante & Yang, 1993; Reed et al, 1994) cytoplasmic E-AspRS. The C-terminal catalytic domain of AspRS is quite typical of a Class II AARS. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al., 2018). 

The catalytic domain of AspRS, much like the other members of subclass IIb, is characterized by the subclass IIb insertion modules 1 and 2. In the special case of AspRS, the first insertion module is considerably more elaborated than the rest of the subclass (Douglas et al. 2023). This extensive module makes up a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices that interacts with the tRNA through a network of water molecules (Ruff et al, 1991; Cavarelli et al, 1993; Cavarelli et al, 1994; Delarue et al, 1994; Eiler et al. 1999). Structural changes throughout the aminoacylation reaction have also been observed (Sauter et al, 2000; Briand et al, 2000). Of note, the catalytic domain of AspRSs and of AsnRSs (designated AsxRS) is also common to metabolic enzymes that synthesize L-asparagine from L-aspartate, such as the archaeal asparagine synthetases (Asn-AR) (Roy et al, 2003; Blaise et al, 2011) and bacterial asparagine synthetase A (Nakatsu et al, 1998; Hinchman et al, 1992). This originates from the fact that B-AspRS, E-AspRS, AsnRS, Asn-AR and bacterial Asn synthetases A have a common evolutionary origin (Kern et al, 2005; Roy et al, 2003).
Eukaryotic (Ruff et al, 1991) and archaeal-type (Schmitt et al, 1998; Charron et al, 2003) AspRSs share a similar overall structure, but bacterial-type AspRSs possess an additional globular domain inserted within the catalytic domain, the GAD domain, and a small C-terminal extension (Delarue et al, 1994).


## Editing
AspRSs present no known editing activity.


## Non-translational functions

In the Baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in addition to its contribution to tRNAAsp binding and aminoacylation (Frugier et al, 2000), the 70 amino acid-long N-terminal extension of the cytoplasmic AspRS has been suggested to intervene in its capacity to bind its own mRNA (Frugier et al, 2003) and to influence the enzyme’s nuclear translocation (Frugier et al, 2005).

In most fungi (specifically in Dikarya, or “true” fungi), two E-AspRSs are usually present: a regular discriminating cytoplasmic E-AspRS that participates in protein synthesis, and a paralogous E-AspRS with an additional LPG_synthase-C domain (InterPro: IPR024320) fused at its C-terminus. This unusual AspRS has first been detected in Aspergillus niger in 2014 (Datt et al, 2014), but the function and large phylogenetic distribution of the enzyme across Dikarya only have been established in 2020 (Yakobov et al, 2020). The AspRS- LPG_synthase-C fusion enzyme has been named ergosteryl-3β-O-L-aspartate synthase (ErdS). The E-AspRS domain presents a regular AspRS activity, uses aspartate, ATP and tRNAAsp to produce Asp-tRNAAsp, which is then transferred to its appended LPG_synthase-C domain that has an Asp-tRNA transferase activity: it catalyzes the transfer of Asp from Asp-tRNAAsp onto the 3β-OH group of ergosterol, the main fungal sterol (Yakobov et al, 2020) and yields ergosteryl-3-O-L-aspartate. 

AspRS domain: $ \text{Asp} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Asp} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{ErdS}} \text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asp} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i $
Asp-tRNA transferase domain: $ \text{Asp-tRNA}^\text{Asp} + \text{ergosterol} \xrightarrow{\text{ErdS}} \text{tRNA}^\text{Asp} + \text{ergosteryl-3(beta)-O-L-aspartate} $

Other enzymes of the same family that synthesize aminoacylated sterols from aminoacyl-tRNAs exist in Dikarya (Yakobov et al, 2022), but are not fused to an AARS domain. Of note, the LPG_synthase-C domain, which catalyzes Asp transfer onto ergosterol is phylogenetically related to the aminoacyl-tRNA transferase domain of bacterial enzymes known as aminoacyl-glycerolipid synthases (or Multiple Peptide Resistance Factors, MprF). These enzymes aminoacylate glycerolipids by using aminoacyl-tRNAs (Lys-tRNALys, Arg-tRNAArg or Ala-tRNAAla) as amino acid donors (Fields & Roy, 2018). In Actinobacteria, some MprFs are fused to a lysyl-tRNA synthetase (Maloney et al, 2009; Smith et al, 2015).



## Clinical significance

Recessive mutations in the human gene DARS1 encoding the cytosolic AspRS cause a phenotype of hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and spasticity (HBSL) (Taft et al. 2013). Similar brain disease LBSL for leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation is caused by recessive mutations in the DARS2 gene encoding the human mitochondrial AspRS (Scheper et al. 2007) (Please refer to AspRS page for information on DARS2).
