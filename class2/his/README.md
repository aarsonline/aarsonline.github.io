Histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid histidine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{His} + \text{tRNA}^\text{His} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{HisRS}} \text{His-tRNA}^\text{His} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $


The catalytic domain of HisRS closely resembles [PheRS](/class2/phe1)  and [SepRS](/class2/sep), which herein constitute subclass IIc (Douglas et al. 2023). However, its C-terminal [anticodon binding domain](/d/hgpt) resembles members of subclass IIa (Wolf et al. 1999), and accordingly some studies have instead classified HisRS under IIa (O'Donoghue et al. 2003, de Pouplana et al. 2001, Perona and Hadd 2012). 


## Structure

The catalytic domain of HisRS is typical of a Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.
Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). HisRS has been a favorable target for studying ancestral urzyme models, consisting of around 130 amino acids. These constructs have yielded robust aminoacylation activity  (Li et al. 2011, Carter Jr and Wills, 2021). 
The catalytic domain is characterized by the ~100 residue HisRS insertion module which resides between motifs 2 and 3 and contains a short $\beta$ strand that runs parallel with the six stranded anti-parallel fold. 
The module recognises the acceptor stem and undergoes vast conformational changes upon tRNA binding (Tian et al. 2015).


In lower eukaryotes, HisRS is among a small subgroup of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (together with [ValRS](/class1/val), [GlyRS](/class2/gly3), and [AlaRS](/class2/ala)) that operate in both the cytosol and the mitochondria.  Localization into these compartments is achieved through alternative initiation, which governs the expression of an N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal (Natsoulis et al. 1986, Chiu et al. 1992). However, in mammals the cytosolic and mitochondrial HisRS are encoded by separate nuclear genes, HARS1 and HARS2 respectively.





## Editing

No editing activity has been reported for HisRS. The imidazole side chain of histidine is extensively recognized through H-bonding interactions in amino acid binding pocket within the catalytic domain (Åberg et al. 1997; Tian et al. 2015).  



## Non-translational functions
Human HisRS can activate immune cells, such as CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, interleukin -2–activated monocytes, and immature dendritic cells by binding to CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) through its N-terminal WHEP domain (Howard et al. 2002). 

HisRS can also interact with Neuropilin-2 (Xu et al., 2020) and acts as an immune modulator (Adams et al., 2021). In a WHEP domain–dependent manner, HisRS inhibits CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation. In mouse and rodent models of acute inflammatory diseases, HisRS administration downregulates immune cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine expression (Adams et al. 2021).

Two HisRS splice variants, which both lack catalytic activity, as well as full-length HisRS are secreted by myoblasts (Zhou et al., 2014). 

HisRS, along with [GlyRS-E](class2/gly3) and [TrpRS](class1/trp), has been reported to interact with Neuropilin-1 in endothelial cells (Gioelli et al., 2022). 

## Clinical significance

Homozygous variant in the HARS1 gene encoding the cytosolic HisRS in humans has been identified to cause Usher syndrome type 3B, characterized by progressive vision and hearing loss during early childhood (Puffenberger et al. 2012). Heterozygous HARS1 variants, on the other hand, underlie autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy phenotypes, classified as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, type 2W (Safka Brozkova et al. 2015).

Biallelic recessive variants in the human gene HARS2 encoding the mitochondrial HisRS cause Perrault syndrome, associated with ovarian dysgenesis and sensorineural hearing loss (firstly described in Pierce et al. 2011). The exhaustive list of disease-causing variants of HARS2 (including location on the sequence and structure, the conservation of affected residues, and the related references) can be found [here](http://misynpat.org/misynpat/PageMaker.rvt?name=HARS2). Mutations have been mapped to all domains of the mt-HisRS.

Serum autoantibodies against HisRS (anti-Jo-1) and other cytosolic aaRSs are the hallmark feature of autoimmune disease anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase syndrome (Kanaji et al. 2023). HisRS is the most common autoantigen among aaRSs (Zampieri et al. 2005).

In a phase 1b/2a clinical trial, intravenously administered HisRS-WHEP domain (in the form of a Fc-fusion protein named efzofitimod) showed beneficial effects in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, a major form of interstitial lung disease (Culver et al. 2023).
