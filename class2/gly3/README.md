The Eukaryotic-like glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS-E) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid glycine to its cognate tRNA:




$\text{Gly} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Gly} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlyRS-E}} \text{Gly-tRNA}^\text{Gly} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i $



GlyRS-E is a homodimeric enzyme found in eukaryotes and some archaea, such as Methanosalsum zhilinae, and is closely related to the archaeal-like form [GlyRS-A](/class2/gly1). These two GlyRS forms differ from the bacterial-like form [GlyRS-B](/class2/gly2), which operates as a heterotetramer and is phylogenetically distinct (Shiba 2005).

In lower eukaryotes, GlyRS-E is among a small subgroup of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (together with [ValRS](/class1/val), [AlaRS](/class2/ala), and [HisRS](/class2/his) (Chatton et al. 1986)) that operate in both the cytosol and the mitochondria. 
In higher eukaryotes including humans, GlyRS-E and [LysRS-II](/class2/lys) are the two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases used in both the cytosol and the mitochondria.
Localization into these compartments is achieved through alternative initiation, which governs the expression of an N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal (Shiba et al. 1994, Chang et al. 2004).
Some eukaryotes contain an additional GlyRS-E gene known as GRS2, which appears to be silent under normal conditions in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and is lacking the lysine rich insert (Chen et al. 2012). 




## Structure


GlyRS-A and -E share a catalytic domain characterized by the presence of two insertion modules that are absent in GlyRS-B.  Insertion modules 1 and 2 (GlyRS-AE IM1 and GlyRS-AE IM2) are located between motifs 1 and 2, and motifs 2 and 3, respectively. In addition, GlyRS-E has a unique insertion module 3 (GlyRS-E IM3) located immediately in front of motif 3.

GlyRS-AE IM1 is a helical bundle connected to the catalytic domain through two short anti-parallel β strands. It appears to be flexible, and likely contacts the acceptor stem during aminoacylation (Qin et al. 2014; Qin et al. 2016). GlyRS-AE IM1 also contains the second ATP binding site for the production of AP4A in an amino-acid independent manner (Guo et al. 2009). GlyRS-AE IM2 associates closely with the catalytic core and extends the central six stranded anti-parallel fold with two additional short β strands (Xie et al. 2007). GlyRS-AE IM2 also contains a lysine rich region, which may facilitate tRNA binding (Chen et al. 2011). GlyRS-E IM3 from the second subunit of the homodimer interacts with the outer corner of the “elbow” of the tRNA to push the tRNA towards the active site of the first subunit (Qin et al. 2016).


GlyRS-A and -E belong to subclass IIa, which includes other enzymes such as [ProRS](/class2/pro1), [SerRS](/class2/ser1), and [ThrRS](/class2/thr) (Valencia-Sánchez et al. 2016, Perona et al. 2012). The [anticodon binding domains](/d/hgpt) of subclass IIa, with the exception of SerRS, are homologous with that of [HisRS](/class2/his), and are located at the C-terminal end (Wolf et al. 1999). The catalytic domain of GlyRS is typical of a Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). GlyRS-A appears to lack editing activity altogether (Gomez and Ibba, 2020). 






## Editing

All GlyRS (GlyRS-B, -A, and -E) lacks editing activity (Gomez et al., 2020). 

## Non-translational functions

Human GlyRS interacts with Neuropilin-1 and its increased aberrant interactions upon confirmational opening caused by point mutations has been linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (He et al., 2015). Mutation-induced gain-of-function interactions of GlyRS with Trk receptors (Sleigh et al., 2017), HDAC6 (Mo et al., 2018; Benoy et al., 2018), and G3BP (Cui et al. 2023) have also been associated with disease initiation or progression in Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. GlyRS binds SIRT2 and inhibits its deacetylation activity, resulting in the acetylated α-tubulin. Mutation-induced loss of GlyRS/SIRT2 interaction additionally has been linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (Zhao et al., 2021).

Human GlyRS was found to have both tumor inhibiting and promoting activities. Extracellular vesicle-associated GlyRS, through its WHEP domain, interacts with CELSR2 to activate M1 polarization and phagocytosis and suppresses tumor initiation (Park et al., 2022). Human GlyRS also interacts with CDH6 via its tRNA-binding domain to induce cancer cell death (Park et al., 2012). In contrast, GlyRS critically supports neddylation by protecting activated E2 and is strongly associated with cancer progression (Mo et al., 2016).

Bovine GlyRS interacts with METLL3 and mediate mTOR and SREBP1 signaling to regulate mike protein and fat synthesis in mammary epithelial cells (Wang et al., 2022).



## Clinical significance

Dominant mutations in human GlyRS-encoding gene GARS1 are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (Antonellis et al. 2003 and others). Overexpression of VEGF (He et al., 2015), Sema2a (Grice et al., 2018), and BDNF (Sleigh et al., 2023), administration of a HDA6 inhibitor (Mo et al., 2018; Benoy et al., 2018), and knockdown of SIRT2 (Zhao et al., 2021) can alleviate disease progression in mice or fly models. Overexpression of the cognate tRNA can completely prevent disease onset in mice (Zuko et al., 2021; Spaulding et al., 2021). 

Recessive mutations in GARS1 are associated with multisystem developmental syndrome, including severe growth retardation, systemic mitochondrial disease, neurological disorder, pulmonic stenosis and atrial septic defect, cardiomyopathy, exercise-induced myalgia, sensorineural hearing loss, lactic acidosis (McMillan  et al., 2014; Oprescu et al., 2017; Nafisinia et al., 2017)

Serum autoantibodies against GlyRS (anti-EJ) and other cytosolic aaRSs are the hallmark feature of autoimmune disease anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase syndrome (Kanaji et al., 2023). Anti–Jo-1 antibodies targeting HisRS are the most common among anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase autoantibodies.
