The Eukaryotic-like glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS-E) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid glycine to its cognate tRNA:




$\text{Gly} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Gly} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlyRS-E}} \text{Gly-tRNA}^\text{Gly} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i $



GlyRS-E is a homodimeric enzyme found in eukaryotes and some archaea, and is closely related to the archaeal-like form [GlyRS-A](/class2/gly1). These two GlyRS forms differ from the bacterial-like form [GlyRS-B](/class2/gly2), which operates as a heterotetramer and is phylogenetically distinct (Shiba 2005).

In lower eukaryotes, GlyRS-E is among a small subgroup of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (together with [ValRS](/class1/val), [AlaRS](/class2/ala), and [HisRS](/class2/his) (Chatton et al. 1986)) that operate in both the cytosol and the mitochondria. 
Localization into these compartments is achieved through alternative initiation, which governs the expression of an N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal (Shiba et al. 1994, Chang et al. 2004).
Some eukaryotes contain an additional GlyRS-E gene known as GRS2, which appears to be silent under normal conditions in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and is lacking the lysine rich insert (Chen et al. 2012). 




## Structure


GlyRS-A and -E a catalytic domain  characterized by the presence of two insertion modules, GlyRS insertion modules 1 and 2, which are located between motifs 2 and 3. Insertion module 1 contains a short $\beta$ strand which runs parallel with the six stranded anti-parallel fold, and likely recognises the acceptor stem (Qin et al. 2014). Insertion module 2 is absent in bacteria and often contains a lysine rich region, which may be involved in differentiating between cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNA$^\text{Gly}$ acceptor stems (Chen et al. 2012).   GlyRS-E is further distinguished by the GlyRS-E insertion module nested within the catalytic domain. This insertion is intrinsically disordered and may be involved in tRNA recognition (Qin et al. 2014). 


The two families belong to subclass IIa, which includes other enzymes such as [ProRS](/class2/pro1), [SerRS](/class2/ser1), and [ThrRS](/class2/thr) (Valencia-SÃ¡nchez et al. 2016, Perona et al. 2012). The [anticodon binding domains](/d/hgpt) of subclass IIa, with the exception of SerRS, are homologous with that of [HisRS](/class2/his), and are located at the C-terminal end (Wolf et al. 1999). The catalytic domain of GlyRS is typical of a Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). GlyRS-A appears to lack editing activity altogether (Gomez and Ibba, 2020). 






## Editing


## Non-translational functions

Human GlyRS interacts with Neuropilin-1 and its increased aberrant interactions upon confirmational opening caused by point mutations has been linked to human diseases (He et al., 2015). GlyRS also interacts with HDAC6 (Mo et al., 2018) and G3BP (Cui et al. 2023), both of which have also been associated with disease progression in Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. 

## Clinical significance

Dominant variants in human GARS1 encoding cytosolic GlyRS are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (James et al., 2006; Eskuri et al., 2012; Griffin et al., 2014, and others). Overexpression of the corresponding tRNA can alleviate disease progression in mice (Zuko et al., 2021; Spaulding et al., 2021).  
There is no specialized mitochondrial GlyRS in humans. GARS1 encodes isoforms that are localized to either compartment.
