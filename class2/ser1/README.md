Seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid serine to its cognate tRNA, as well as the tRNA of selenocysteine. These reactions proceed through the following mechanisms:




$ \text{Ser} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Ser} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{SerRS}} \text{Ser-tRNA}^\text{Ser} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $
$ \text{Ser} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Sec} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{SerRS}} \text{Ser-tRNA}^\text{Sec} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $


This first reaction enables the incorporation of serine into the polypeptide, while the second enables incorporation of the 21st proteinogenic amino acid selenocysteine (Lee et al. 1989). The latter is achieved by incorporating selenocysteine at the position of the UGA stop codon, rather than stopping translation. The efficiency of this process is determined by a range of regulatory factors. 

SerRS is part of subclass IIa alongside [ProRS](/class2/pro1), [ThrRS](/class2/thr), and the [dimeric GlyRS](/class2/gly1) (Gomez and Ibba 2020, Valencia-SÃ¡nchez et al. 2016, Perona et al. 2012). 
SerRS stands apart from the rest of the subclass due to its abnormal tRNA binding domain - the N-terminal long variable arm (Dock-Bregon et al. 1990).
The mammalian mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> molecules deviate markedly from their cytosolic counterparts. Hence, the mammalian mitochondrial SerRS N-terminal domain differs in such organisms, while still retaining its coiled coil structure (Chimnaronk et al. 2005).
Many animals, notably insects, contain a paralog of SerRS (seryl-tRNA synthetase-like insect mitochondrial protein, SLIMP) which forms a heterodimer with the mitochondrial SerRS and is involved in cell regulation (Guitart et al. 2010, Picchioni et al. 2019). 


In contrast, the C-terminal catalytic domain of SerRS is quite typical of a class II aaRS. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). 
The catalytic domain is a seven stranded antiparallel fold.


Editing in SerRS occurs at the pre-transfer level, despite lacking an edit domain. This process has been characterized for threonine, cysteine, and serine hydroxamate (Gruic-Sovulj et al. 2007). 


There is also a [second class II SerRS](/class2/ser2), evolutionarily distinct from this one, which is found in methanogenic archaea (Bilokapic et al. 2006).
