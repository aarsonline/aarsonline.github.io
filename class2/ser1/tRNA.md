Serine is the only amino acid whose codons vary at all three positions.
In the standard genetic code for instance, serine, leucine, and arginine are the only three amino acids whose set of codons contain more than one possible nucleotide at the first codon position, but serine stands alone in its acceptance of more than one possibility at the second codon position. These six codons are: UCU, UCA, UCC, UCG, AGU, and AGC. 
Moreover, serine has inherited additional codons in many non-standard genetic codes, including AGA and AGG in various mitochondrial genetic codes (NCBI genetic codes 5, 9, and 14), and CUG in the alternative Yeast genetic code (code 12).
SerRS also recognises the UGA stop codon for incorporating selenocysteine.


  

This idiosyncrasy has implications for tRNA binding (Weygand-Durasevic and Cusack 2005). Unlike most tRNAs which bind to their cognate aaRS via the anticodon, tRNA$^\text{Ser}$ binds to SerRS via its long variable arm (Dock-Bregon et al. 1990), and unlike most tRNA binding domains which exist as globular domains, the tRNA binding domain of SerRS is an antiparallel coiled coil.  During catalysis, the coiled coil of one SerRS subunit interacts with the minor groove of the variable arm of  tRNA$^\text{Ser}$ and directs its acceptor stem into the active site of the other SerRS subunit (Biou et al. 1994). 



These tRNA structures were annotated by [tRNAviz](http://trna.ucsc.edu/tRNAviz/summary/) (Lin et al. 2019), with identity elements indicated as described by Gieg√© and Eriani, 2023.
