The Archaeal-like glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS-A) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid glycine to its cognate tRNA:



$ \text{Gly} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Gly} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlyRS-A}} \text{Gly-tRNA}^\text{Gly} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $

GlyRS-A is a homodimeric enzyme found in archaea and some bacteria, and is closely related to the eukaryote-like form [GlyRS-E](/class2/gly3). The two families have a catalytic domain  characterized by the presence of two insertion modules, GlyRS insertion modules 1 and 2, which are located between motifs 2 and 3. Insertion module 1 contains a short $\beta$ strand which runs parallel with the six stranded anti-parallel fold, and likely recognises the acceptor stem (Qin et al. 2014). Insertion module 2 is absent in bacteria. GlyRS-E is further distinguished by an additional insertion module nested within the catalytic domain. These two forms differ from the bacterial-like form [GlyRS-B](/class2/gly2), which operates as a heterotetramer and is phylogenetically distinct (Shiba 2005).


GlyRS-A and -E belong to subclass IIa, which includes other enzymes such as [ProRS](/class2/pro1), [SerRS](/class2/ser1), and [ThrRS](/class2/thr) (Gomez et al. 2020, Valencia-SÃ¡nchez et al. 2016, Perona et al. 2012). The [anticodon binding domains](/superfamily/class2/Anticodon_binding_domain_HGPT) of subclass IIa, with the exception of SerRS, are homologous with that of [HisRS](/class2/his), and are located at the C-terminal end (Wolf et al. 1999). The catalytic domain of GlyRS is typical of a Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). GlyRS-A appears to lack editing activity altogether (Gomez et al. 2020).
