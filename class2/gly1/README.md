The Archaeal-like glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS-A) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid glycine to its cognate tRNA:



$ \text{Gly} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Gly} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlyRS-A}} \text{Gly-tRNA}^\text{Gly} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $





GlyRS-A is a homodimeric enzyme found in archaea and some bacteria, such as *Thermus thermophilus*, and is closely related to the eukaryote-like form [GlyRS-E](/class2/gly3).  These two forms differ from the bacterial-like form [GlyRS-B](/class2/gly2), which operates as a heterotetramer and is phylogenetically distinct (Shiba 2005).



## Structure

GlyRS-A and -E share a catalytic domain characterized by the presence of two insertion modules that are absent in GlyRS-B.  Insertion modules 1 and 2 (GlyRS-AE IM1 and GlyRS-AE IM2) are located between motifs 1 and 2, and motifs 2 and 3, respectively. GlyRS-AE IM1 is a helical bundle connected to the catalytic domain through two short anti-parallel β strands. It appears to be flexible, and likely contacts the acceptor stem during aminoacylation (Qin et al. 2014; Qin et al. 2016). GlyRS-AE IM1 also contains the second ATP binding site for the production of AP4A in an amino-acid independent manner (Guo et al. 2009). GlyRS-AE IM2 associates closely with the catalytic core and extends the central six stranded anti-parallel fold with two additional short β strands (Xie et al. 2007). GlyRS-E is further distinguished by an additional insertion module nested within the catalytic domain.

GlyRS-A and -E belong to subclass IIa, which includes other enzymes such as [ProRS](/class2/pro1), [SerRS](/class2/ser1), and [ThrRS](/class2/thr) (Gomez et al. 2020, Valencia-Sánchez et al. 2016, Perona et al. 2012). The [anticodon binding domains](/d/hgpt) of subclass IIa, with the exception of SerRS, are homologous with that of [HisRS](/class2/his), and are located at the C-terminal end (Wolf et al. 1999). The catalytic domain of GlyRS is typical of a Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). 





## Editing
All GlyRS (GlyRS-B, -A, and -E) lack editing activity (Gomez et al., 2020).

Being the smallest amino acid, recognition of glycine against non-cognate amino acids is through steric hindrance. The small amino acid binding pocket of GlyRS is enclosed upon ATP binding and can only accommodate glycine (Guo et al. 2009). 

The discrimination of the near-cognate alanine is made in bacterial GlyRS by two nearly absolutely conserved Thr residues (T140 and T158 in Aquifex aeolicus) that also bind a solvent molecule; in eukaryotic GlyRS this task is done mainly through a non-conserved Ser or Ala residue (S524 in human), equivalent of T158 in Aquifex aeolicus (Valencia-Sánchez, Marco Igor, et al. 2016).
