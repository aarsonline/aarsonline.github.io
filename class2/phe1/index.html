<h1>Phenylalanyl-tRNA Synthetase &alpha; Subunit (Bacterial-like)</h1><br><br>


The bacterial-like phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS-B) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid phenylalanine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Phe} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{PheRS-B}} \text{Phe-tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $





The phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS) are considered to be one of the most evolutionarily complex enzymes among aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Klipcan et al. 2010).
Unlike most Class II synthetases, which are homodimeric, PheRS-B operates as a heterotetramer composed of two $\alpha$ and two $\beta$ subunits $\alpha_2 \beta_2$. 
There are three known variants of PheRS: one found predominantly in bacteria, one found in eukaryotes/archaea [PheRS-A](/class2/phe3), and one localized to eukaryotic organelles [PheRS-M](/class2/phe5). 
This page specifically refers to the $\alpha$ subunit of the bacterial variant (PheRS-B$\alpha$). 



The catalytic activity of PheRS-B is confined to the $\alpha$ subunit, while tRNA recognition and editing activity is executed by the $\beta$ subunit, 
which is over twice the size of $\alpha$ (Fishman et al. 2001). The other heterotetrameric Class II synthetase is the bacterial [GlyRS-B](/class2/gly2), which is also composed of two catalytic $\alpha$ subunits and two non-catalytic  $\beta$ subunits. 
However, unlike GlyRS-B, efficient catalysis in PheRS-B is not possible without the full tetrameric assembly (Mosyak et al. 1995). 
PheRS-B binds two tRNA molecules, with each tRNA binding across all four subunits (Goldgur et al. 1997). 

The C-terminal catalytic core is similar to that of other PheRS families, as well as [HisRS](/class2/his) and [SepRS](/class2/sep), which together comprise subclass IIc
(Douglas et al. 2023, Kavran et al. 2007, Perona et al. 2012, Valencia-Sánchez et al. 2016). Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). The flexible N-terminal helical arm (A1) is intrinsically disordered, however it adopts a coiled coil structure upon interaction with the tRNA (Goldgur et al. 1997). Editing in the bacterial PheRS is performed by the [&beta; subunit](/class2/phe1).
