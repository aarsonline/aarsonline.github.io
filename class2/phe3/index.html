<h1>Phenylalanyl-tRNA Synthetase &alpha; Subunit (Archaeal-like)</h1><br><br>


The archaeal-like phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS-A) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid phenylalanine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Phe} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{PheRS-A}} \text{Phe-tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



The phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS) are considered to be one of the most evolutionarily complex enzymes among aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Klipcan et al. 2010).
Unlike most Class II synthetases, which are homodimeric, PheRS-A operates as a heterotetramer composed of two $\alpha$ and two $\beta$ subunits $\alpha_2 \beta_2$. 
There are three known variants of PheRS: one found predominantly in eukaryotes/archaea, one found in bacteria [PheRS-B](/class2/phe1), and one localized to eukaryotic organelles [PheRS-M](/class2/phe5). 
This page specifically refers to the $\alpha$ subunit of the archaral-like variant (PheRS-A$\alpha$). 



Although both PheRS-A subunits possess a Class II catalytic domain, catalytic activity appears to be restricted to the $\alpha$ subunit. tRNA recognition also occurs in the $\alpha$ chain (in contrast to the bacterial tetramer, for which anticodon recognition occurs through the $\beta$ chain), and editing activity is restricted to $\beta$.  The C-terminal catalytic core is similar to that of other PheRS families, as well as [HisRS](/class2/his) and [SepRS](/class2/sep), which together comprise subclass IIc
(Douglas et al. 2023, Kavran et al. 2007, Perona et al. 2012, Valencia-Sánchez et al. 2016).


The catalytic domain of PheRS-A&alpha; is similar to other class II members, and contains six antiparallel strands. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018).  
The PheRS-A$\alpha$ catalytic domain is characterised by the short PheRS-A; insertion module, which resides between motifs 2 and 3 (Douglas et al. 2023).



The anticodon binding domain is proposed to be a short loop upstream of the catalytic core (Finarov et al. 2010). The N-terminal domains resemble DNA binding proteins, however their function roles are still under investigation (Ho et al. 2022).
