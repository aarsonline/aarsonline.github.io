O-phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the non-proteinogenic amino acid o-phosphoserine to the tRNA of cysteine:



$ \text{Sep} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{SepRS}} \text{Sep-tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $





In certain methanogenic archaea, the standard Class I [CysRS](/class1/cys/) is absent, thus, the non-canonical SepRS charges $\text{tRNA}^\text{Cys}$ with o-phosphoserine, which is then converted into cysteine by Cys-tRNA synthetase (Sauerwald et al. 2005). Unlike most Class II synthetases, SepRS exists as a homotetramer (Fukunaga and Shigeyuki 2007). 

The catalytic domain of SepRS shares structural similarities with that of [HisRS](/class2/his) and [PheRS](/class2/phe1), which comprise subclass IIc (Douglas et al. 2023, Kavran et al. 2007, Perona et al. 2012, Valencia-SÃ¡nchez et al. 2016). The catalytic domain is typical among class II enzymes, containing six antiparallel strands. The binding of ATP is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). The catalytic domain is characterized by the 70-80 residue SepRS insertion module, which resides between motifs 1 and 2  (Douglas et al. 2023). This module is intrinsically disordered (Kamtekar et a. 2007). The C-terminal domain recognises the anticodon of $\text{tRNA}^\text{Cys}$ (Fukunaga and Shigeyuki 2007). Editing has not been observed in SerRS-A (Gomez et al. 2020).
