O-phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the non-proteinogenic amino acid O-phosphoserine to tRNA$^\text{Cys}$:



$ \text{Sep} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{SepRS}} \text{Sep-tRNA}^\text{Cys} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $


Unlike most Class II synthetases, SepRS exists as a homotetramer (Fukunaga and Shigeyuki 2007). The tetramer binds two tRNACys molecules and functions via half-of-the-sites activity (Hauenstein et al., 2008).


In certain methanogenic archaea, the standard Class I [CysRS](/class1/cys/) is absent. To encode cysteine in these organisms, SepRS charges tRNA$^\text{Cys}$ with O-phosphoserine (Sep), to form Sep-tRNA$^\text{Cys}$. This intermediate is then converted to Cys-tRNA$^\text{Cys}$ by a pyridoxyl phosphate-dependent enzyme, Sep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase (SepCysS) (Sauerwald et al. 2005). In ancestral methanogens, a third protein, SepCysE, forms a bridge between SepRS and SepCysS to create a ternary complex named the transsulfursome (Liu et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017). The route to biosynthesis of cysteine in methanogens also depends on the activity of SepCysS (Sauerwald et al., 2005; Rauch et al., 2017; Mukai et al., 2022). 


## Structure
The catalytic domain of SepRS shares structural similarities with that of [HisRS](/class2/his) and [PheRS](/class2/phe1), which comprise subclass IIc (Douglas et al. 2023, Kavran et al. 2007, Perona et al. 2012, Valencia-SÃ¡nchez et al. 2016). The catalytic domain is typical among class II enzymes, containing six antiparallel strands. The binding of ATP is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). The catalytic domain is characterized by the 70-80 residue SepRS insertion module, which resides between motifs 1 and 2 (Douglas et al. 2023). This module is intrinsically disordered (Kamtekar et a. 2007). The C-terminal domain recognises the anticodon of tRNACys, and specificity-determining interactions are made with G34, C35 and A36 (Fukunaga and Shigeyuki 2007). However, few interactions are found between the enzyme and other portions of the tRNA, and docking of the tRNA 3'-end into the enzyme active site is also not observed. Therefore, a reliable structural basis for the function of SepRS has yet to be determined.
