The archaeal-like phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS-A) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid phenylalanine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Phe} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{PheRS-A}} \text{Phe-tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



The phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS) are considered to be one of the most evolutionarily complex enzymes among aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Klipcan et al. 2010).
Unlike most Class II synthetases, which are homodimeric, PheRS-A operates as a heterotetramer composed of two $\alpha$ and two $\beta$ subunits $\alpha_2 \beta_2$. 
There are three known variants of PheRS: one found predominantly in eukaryotes/archaea, one found in bacteria [PheRS-B](/class2/phe1), and one localized to eukaryotic organelles [PheRS-M](/class2/phe5). 
This page specifically refers to the $\beta$ subunit of the archaral-like variant (PheRS-A$\beta$). 




The catalytic activity and tRNA recognition of PheRS-A is restricted to the $\alpha$ subunit, while  editing activity is restricted to the &beta; subunit, which is over twice the size of the &alpha; subunit (Fishman et al. 2001). The only other tetrameric member of Class II is the bacterial [GlyRS-B](/class2/gly2), which is also composed of two catalytic $\alpha$ subunits and two non-catalytic $\beta$ subunits.

Although both subunits of PheRS-A possess a Class II catalytic domain, catalytic activity appears to be restricted to the $\alpha$ subunit. tRNA recognition also occurs in the $\alpha$ chain (in contrast to the bacterial tetramer for which tRNA binding occurs in the [&beta; chain](/class2/phe2/), while editing activity is restricted to $\beta$. The editing domain (hB3 and hB4) is located near the N-terminal and resembles that of PheRS-B&beta; (Finarov et al. 2010), which is known to target mischarged tyrosines (Roy et al. 2004).

The catalytic domain does not appear to possess catalytic activity (Fishman et al. 2001), but still contains the six antiparallel strands characteristic of a Class II AARS. As such, the sequence at the structural positions of motifs 1, 2, and 3 do not follow the motif patterns. The positions one would normally expect to see these motifs are labeled below for convenience.
