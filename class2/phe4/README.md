The archaeal-like phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS-A) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid phenylalanine to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Phe} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{PheRS-A}} \text{Phe-tRNA}^\text{Phe} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $



The phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS) are considered to be one of the most evolutionarily complex enzymes among aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Klipcan et al. 2010).
Unlike most Class II synthetases, which are homodimeric, PheRS-A operates as a heterotetramer composed of two $\alpha$ and two $\beta$ subunits $\alpha_2 \beta_2$. 
There are three known variants of PheRS: one found predominantly in eukaryotes/archaea, one found in bacteria [PheRS-B](/class2/phe1), and one localized to eukaryotic organelles [PheRS-M](/class2/phe5). 
This page specifically refers to the $\beta$ subunit of the archaral-like variant (PheRS-A$\beta$). 




## Structure

The catalytic activity and tRNA recognition of PheRS-A is restricted to the $\alpha$ subunit, while  editing activity is restricted to the &beta; subunit, which is over twice the size of the &alpha; subunit (Fishman et al. 2001). 
tRNA recognition also occurs in the $\alpha$ chain (in contrast to the bacterial tetramer for which tRNA binding occurs in the [&beta; chain](/class2/phe2/).
The only other tetrameric member of Class II is the bacterial [GlyRS-B](/class2/gly2), which is also composed of two catalytic $\alpha$ subunits and two non-catalytic $\beta$ subunits.


The $\beta$ chain has a homolog of the catalytic domain containing the six antiparallel strands characteristic of a Class II AARS, but it does not display catalytic activity (Fishman et al. 2001).
As such, the sequence at the structural positions of motifs 1, 2, and 3 do not follow the motif patterns. The positions one would normally expect to see these motifs are labeled below for convenience.






## Editing


The post-transfer editing domain (hB3 and hB4) is located near the N-terminal and resembles that of PheRS-B&beta; (Finarov et al. 2010), which is known to target mischarged tyrosines (Roy et al. 2004).
