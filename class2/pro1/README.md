The archaeal-like prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS-A) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid proline to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Pro} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Pro} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{ProRS-A}} \text{Pro-tRNA}^\text{Pro} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $






## Structure

ProRS-A is closely related to [ProRS-B](/class2/pro2), which is found in most bacteria, and [ProRS-M](/class2/pro3), which is localized to organelles.
They possess distinct domain architectures (Musier-Forsyth et al. 2005). ProRS-B contains an editing domain inserted within the catalytic domain, while ProRS-A has a C-terminal zinc binding domain that is around 80 amino acids in length. The functional activity of the zinc binding domain remains unclear, but it appears to be essential for ProRS catalytic activity (Vasu et al. 2021). 
The three types of ProRS belong to subclass IIa, which includes other enzymes such as [ThrRS](/class2/thr), [SerRS](/class2/ser1), and the dimeric [GlyRS](/class2/gly1) (Gomez and Ibba 2020, Valencia-SÃ¡nchez et al. 2016, Perona et al. 2012). The [anticodon binding domains](/superfamily/class2/Anticodon_binding_domain_HGPT) of subclass IIa, with the exception of SerRS, are homologous with that of [HisRS](/class2/his), and are located at the C-terminal end (Wolf et al. 1999). The catalytic domain of ProRS is typical of a Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). 



In most animals, including humans, prolyl-tRNA is produced by a fusion protein glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) (Berthonneau et al. 2000). 
EPRS contains the catalytic domains from both [GluRS-E](/class1/glu3/) and ProRS-A, as well as the ProRS-A zinc binding domain, and the GluRS GST domain. 
Glutamic acid is a metabolic precursor for proline, which suggests a possible explanation for the origin of this protein (Eswarappa et al. 2018). 





## Editing


Post-transfer editing allows the removal of mischarged residues from $\text{tRNA}^\text{Pro}$. In ProRS-B, the deacylation of mischarged cysteine and alanine can occur through an edit domain located between motifs 2 and 3 of the catalytic domain. This process is quite inefficient for cysteine in particular, and the domain is lacking entirely from ProRS-A.  As such, there are trans-acting factors which remove these mischarged residues from $\text{tRNA}^\text{Pro}$, such as YbaK for cysteine and ProXp-ala for alanine. These factors are paralogs of the ProRS-B editing domain (Vargas-Rodriguez and Musier-Forsyth 2013, An and Musier-Forsyth 2004). 




## Non-translational functions

In human cells, EPRS is part of the of the interferon (IFN)- gamma-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex involved in translational silencing of genes involved in inflammation (Sampath et al., 2004). 
It is also a mTOR-S6K1 effector that regulates long-chain fatty acid uptake (Arif et al., 2017).
 All these noncanonical function of EPRS are regulated by posttranslational modification of the WHEP domains of EPRS (Jia et al., 2008).




## Clinical significance

The human EPRS gene is involved in autosomal recessive hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 15 (HLD15), which is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations (Mendes et al. 2018).
