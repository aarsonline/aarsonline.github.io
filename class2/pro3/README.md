The mitochondrial-like prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS-M) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid proline to its cognate tRNA:




$ \text{Pro} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Pro} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{ProRS-M}} \text{Pro-tRNA}^\text{Pro} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i  $





## Structure

ProRS-M is closely related to [ProRS-A](/class2/pro1), which is found in archaea, eukaryotic cytosols, and some bacteria, and [ProRS-B](/class2/pro2), which is found in bacteria.
They possess distinct domain architectures (Musier-Forsyth et al. 2005). ProRS-B contains an editing domain inserted within the catalytic domain, while ProRS-A has a C-terminal zinc binding domain that is around 80 amino acids in length. The functional activity of the zinc binding domain remains unclear, but it appears to be essential for ProRS catalytic activity (Vasu et al. 2021). 
The three types of ProRS belong to subclass IIa, which includes other enzymes such as [ThrRS](/class2/thr), [SerRS](/class2/ser1), and the dimeric [GlyRS](/class2/gly1) (Gomez et al. 2020, Valencia-Sánchez et al. 2016, Perona et al. 2012). The [anticodon binding domains](/superfamily/class2/Anticodon_binding_domain_HGPT) of subclass IIa, with the exception of SerRS, are homologous with that of [HisRS](/class2/his), and are located at the C-terminal end (Wolf et al. 1999). The catalytic domain of ProRS is typical of a Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Like most members of the superfamily, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). 



ProRS-M is predicted to localize to organelles and is one of the few AARS families which are lacking an experimentally solved structure. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the enzyme was derived from the bacterial form ProRS-B, likely concurring with mitochondrial/chloroplast endosymbiosis (Douglas et al. 2023). Shortly after this event, the post-transfer editing domain was deleted in most members of ProRS-M. However, the N- and C-terminal regions flanking this excision site were retained, an evolutionary "scar". This scar is rich in highly conserved cysteine residues, and its functional status is unclear.
