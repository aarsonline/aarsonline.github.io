The Bacterial-like glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS-B), also known as the orphan GlyRS, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid glycine to its cognate tRNA:

  
  
  
  

$ \text{Gly} + \text{tRNA}^\text{Gly} + \text{ATP} \xrightarrow{\text{GlyRS-B}} \text{Gly-tRNA}^\text{Gly} + \text{AMP} + \text{PP}_i $

  
  
GlyRS-B is exclusively found in bacteria and chloroplasts. In most bacteria, GlyRS-B is heterotetrameric. 
GlyRS-B is phylogenetically distinct from the dimeric families [GlyRS-A](/class2/gly1) and [GlyRS-E](/class2/gly3), which are present in archaea, eukaryotes, and some bacteria (Shiba, 2005).



## Structure

While most Class II synthetases which are homodimeric, GlyRS-B operates as a heterotetramer composed of two $\alpha$ subunits and two $\beta$ subunits.
 Other Class II tetramers include [PheRS](/class2/phe1) and [SepRS](/class2/sep). In chloroplasts (Uwer et al. 1998) and certain bacteria, such as *Chlamydia trachomatis*,
 the two subunits are encoded by a single gene and the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ regions are part of the same protomer (Wagar et al. 1995). The full length $\alpha$-$\beta$ GlyRS-B forms a homodimer.
 The fusion or fission of AARS genes that result in switching between homodimeric and heterotetrameric enzymes has also been observed in AlaRS and [PylRS](/class2/pyl).
 The catalytic domain of GlyRS-B is the smallest among all of Class II. The catalytic domains of AlaRS and GlyRS-B, which constitute subclass IId (Valencia-Sánchez et al., 2016), 
are characterized by absence of the small interface between motifs 1 and 2 (Douglas et al. 2023). 
The small interface promotes dimerization in other Class II synthetases (Qiu et al. 1999, Schmitt et al. 1998), while AlaRS and GlyRS-B form oligomers through alternative means. 


  
  
  

Both subunit species are essential for GlyRS-B activity (Ostrem et al., 1974). The $\alpha$ subunits contain all of the determinants for activating glycine independently of the $\beta$ subunits when they form a dimer. The $\alpha$ subunit dimer is supported by a C-terminal three helix bundle (Tan et al. 2012). Like most Class II synthetases, ATP binding is coordinated by the arginine tweezers, located in motifs 2 and 3 (Kaiser et al. 2018). The $\beta$ subunits, significantly larger in size, contain tRNA recognition elements essential for producing Gly-tRNA$^\text{Gly}$ and do not display catalytic activity (Nagel et al., 1984). The $\alpha$-$\beta$ dimer identifies the L-shaped tRNA structure (Nagato et al., 2023). Additional tRNA recognition occurs through the [ancient tRNA latch](/d/atl) (ATL) and the [anticodon binding](/d/crimvl) domains. The ATL domain interacts with the tRNA acceptor stem and is homologous to the alpha helix rich tRNA binding domain in AlaRS, also known as the Mid1 subdomain (Yu et al., 2023, Alvarez-Carreño et al., 2024).
The [anticodon binding domain](/d/crimvl) interacts with the anticodon region of tRNAGly and is also found in ArgRS, CysRS, LeuRS, ValRS, MetRS, and IleRS (Yu et al., 2023), which are class I synthetases.
  
  


 





## Editing

It appears that GlyRS-B lacks editing activity (Gomez et al., 2020).
